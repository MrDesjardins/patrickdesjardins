The class has less boilerplate to configure reducing the cognitive load to understand each part.

The observation is valid. However, the emphasis of these two patterns is that one relies on a class, the second not, and that without relying on a class, you must store the values of the context somewhere. In this article, I am storing the value inside a React state (useState). Another option could be to use store the values directly into the ECMAScript module where the \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"createContext\"), \" is called.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In either case, you have all the flexibility you desire and you will not be constrained. A heuristic I found is that if you need to have a context with reactive content, for example, a message that displays on the screen, the object pattern is ideal: because the data is stored in a state, the consumer with \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"useContext\"), \" will receive the new value and the one responsible to display the message in the user interface can react naturally. The class pattern is less prone to reactivity since the value will change but React will not render a change. Hence, I found using the class pattern in scenarios where I am pushing changes. For example, a context that checks the user's permission where the context was filled at the beginning of the application's boot process and then kept the value in the context to be consumed as needed.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"id":"1434cc58-85c1-5881-b84d-d54eaa9981cd","totalPages":75}},
