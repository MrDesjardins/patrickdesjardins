Even if the Framework has been released about 2 weeks ago and this might looks rapid, it's not that much. It's not because it has been in RC since few months and in beta for even more time. Some time, instead of fighting against feature like keeping adding classes to support enumeration or to do some gymnastic with C# to turn around bugs it's just a better idea to upgrade.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"First of all, we use NutGet to get the package but we do not use the default mechanism.

Well, with Entity Framework 5.0, NotMappedAttribute doesn't work. It's now only NotMapped.\\n\\nAnd that was it. Not a big deal. We are using Code First, so, no EDMX file is present and so than nothing to update. The DbContext hasn't change and everything compiled correctly.
