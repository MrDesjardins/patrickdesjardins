On the long run, you accumulate a lot of values by having a fast way to see if something has changed that wasn't originally planned. It serves as a good living documentation (if tests are simple to understand). The current trend in the industry is to rely solely on automated tests. Whence, all tests need to be well written. Writing good unit tests is something that is harder that you can think. Since the last 2 years, I have been in multiple teams and I realized that most people do not really know how to unit test properly.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One thing that need to be clear is that even if you touched a line with a test, it doesn't mean that this one doesn't need to be touched by multiple tests. I see often people running code coverage to know if they are done or not when testing. That is wrong.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A second thing is that each method needs different amount of test depending of the complexity of those ones. You cannot have only one successful unit test, and one failure unit test and be done with your method.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another concept that seem to be not understood is that even if you \\\"know\\\" that the value in parameter will never be null, you have to test it for null if you allow it. You cannot discriminate scenario because you know what is the current use of the code.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There is also the notion of the coverage not being a good metric to know if you have a well written plan. While I agree that 100% doesn't mean 100% free bug, I do not agree that it's acceptable to have 50% of coverage. If your software quality bar is to have only 50% of your code tested, than it means that you are not ready to not have human to test your software. In fact, you should probably test your code to have above 100% coverage -- multiple lines will get hit per multiple tests.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Assertions is also debatable. Most of the time, people are asserting a lot of variable which make the test hard to maintain. Every tests should assert a minimum set of variable. In fact, you should aim to assert a specific scenario. If you are asserting a lot, than you are probably testing more than one thing, thus not testing a unit but a batch. Some exception are clear, for example, testing to map a class to another class. However, a rule of thumb is to identify these big tests and make them smaller by dividing the actual code into several methods.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Preparing your unit tests should be clean. You shouldn't have to write 20 lines of code in each of your test to create your scenario to test. Divide that arrange code into builder class. This way, they can be reused across several tests.

This is something everyone should do. What happen if at some point a default value change but was required to be a specific value depending of the scenario. Without this test, you are not notified that something is breaking from the expected value. In that example, the expected value is NULL. If someone change it to an empty string, this might break other scenario that rely to compare on NULL to determine some state. Another testing scenario that I see often is about passing wrong value has parameter. In that particular example, null will break and return a null reference exception.

Second, today it's an exception, tomorrow it could be that we return a value. A change will make this particular test that expect a specific exception to become red and thus having a change in the test. The third reason is that if another exception is thrown, that I'll get an error. I expect to only have an argument null exception, not a null reference or an overflow.

Automated tests take about 30-50% of the development time when well done. Your code base will have has many line of code for tests and for code. That is the cost of being able to run a lot of test multiple times per day as well as not having human resource to test. It's worth it because all these scenarios are hard to test for a human and since these tests are supposed to be fast, that you can run them often. The gain is enormous as the size of your code base increase. Your confidence in changing your code should remain high and new developer coming into the team won't be afraid to change something that disrupt the expectation.
