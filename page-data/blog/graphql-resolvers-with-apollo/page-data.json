It means that if in the graph we have several times the same entity to query that we will only do it once -- at the end. From these two summaries, it is clear that one is to optimize the query in term of figuring out which would be the best while the second is to avoid redundant calls.

Even if the GraphQL is connected directly to a database, it would not be performant on a big list of children. The database scenario is often easier to visualize. Instead of making several SELECT statement with a WHERE clause that specify a single child ID, we would do a SELECT statement with a IN clause that specify the array of IDs.
