Left Join or Left Inner Join let you return all data from the Where criterion and try to Join. If data is found, it will output them, otherwise, it will return NULL. This is different from Inner Join or Join that would have simply not return this row.\\n\\n## Right Join or Right Outer Join\\n\\nThe Right Join statement also known as Right Outer Join is the mirror of the Left Outer Join. That mean that all results are from from the Joined table and then the join is try. If no data is found, NULL is returned.\\n\\n## Cross Join\\n\\nCross Join is a Cartesian product. That mean that all data from the left side and join them to the right. The previous example with the Where statement that is query to '<=3' has 3 EmployeeTerritories. The Join Territories table contains 53 territories. If we execute a Group Statement to know how many Territories the EmployeeTerritories have per EmployeeID this will give you the number to multiply to 53 to know the amount or row returned.\\n\\n\\n```sql\\n SELECT EmployeeID, count(TerritoryID) FROM EmployeeTerritories WHERE EmployeeTerritories.EmployeeID <= 3 GROUP BY EmployeeID \\n\")), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"EmployeeID|count(TerritoryID)\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"1\\t    2\\n2\\t    7\\n3\\t    4\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This give 13 totals amount of Employees/Territories that will be Cross Joined to 53 territories.
