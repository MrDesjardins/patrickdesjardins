With code, the circuit breaker pattern is useful when we access a resource that can slow down the system. For example, you have a website that connect different services on different servers, and one server goes down. You do not want subsequent calls to that server to call all the time that server. Mostly because it will slow down the whole website by having to timeout before being able to continue the code. This is a simple example, but this can be applied to other scenarios. The principle remains the same: execute some code, if it works nothing change; if it fails than we put the system into a close state. The open state allows to skip trying to execute the failed code and do something else until the circuit goes into an alternate state where it tries again to see if it can close the circuit again.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The circuit breaker demonstrates, here, does not rely on a timer.
