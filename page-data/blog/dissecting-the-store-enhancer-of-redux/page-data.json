The return function that returns a function is actually calling createStore with the args list of argument. At that point, the function could return the result and nothing would be changed. Obviously, something will be done. First, the method takes a reference to the actual dispatch function. Then, it creates an object that will be passed down to all middleware. This object has the actual store's state and a dispatch function that call the original dispatch function. The whole middleware logic is the next line which will invoke all the middleware passed by parameter one at a time. The middleware passed by parameter are functions are well, which take the \\\"middlewareAPI\\\" object. At that point, we only have middleware function that is having access to the getState and dispatch functions. The next line will chain them by passing the store.dispatch function. Every middleware has access to the next one by calling \\\"next\\\". Often you will see that people invoke \\\"next\\\" with a new action.
