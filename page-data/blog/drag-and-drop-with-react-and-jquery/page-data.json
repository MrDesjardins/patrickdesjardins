Few months ago, we needed to have dragging capability with out React page. Initially, we though to use Html5 but we the experience was different between browsers in term of dragging experience. There is some nice well build third party library but we also had the constraint of bringing new library in with all the trouble of handling licencing which become fast a nightmare with today's library that have a lot of dependencies.
