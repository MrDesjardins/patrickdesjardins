This trend of not commenting code is still there and I am more and more curious because the more I work and preach to comment code, the more I see people commenting.

I also am with you by having proper, good written, unit tests that we could have figure that all. But, we live in the real world where time is always ticking and by experience I clearly know that even in the best company, in the best product, in the best teams, we have to ship features and not follow all the perfect path. That is why, commenting can save a lot of time. In less than 15 seconds, I was able to write this comment which will save minutes to people coming after me to work on that code.
