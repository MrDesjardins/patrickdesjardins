You cannot edit it with your phone, neither with your band. The user experience is not good and it was definitely not oriented to people that create their own workout.

Zeo is a head band that you have on your forehead during your sleep and it keeps track of your brain activity. Let me tell you that Microsoft Band is really far from being accurate. First, I do not move when I try to get to sleep. So, Microsoft Band think I am sleeping because I am also someone that go very fast with a slow heart beat. Zeo head band can give me 20 minutes while Microsoft Band will give me 10 minutes. The problem is more than that. When I sleep, I know that I have always 2 periods of deep sleep. I have been like that since years and my cycle I just not regular like we would expected. That said, Microsoft Band only find one of those two deep sleep cycle. Finally, since the last half of my night I am only in REM, I tend to move quick a bit but I am not awake. Microsoft Band records these movement has I was awake, so I have a lot of awake period. Finally, the smart alarm take so much time to kick in that I have most of the time the time to wait more than 5 minutes, eyes open before it starts. This is also probably because my heart beat remains very low until I am out of the bed. Zeo head band had also a smart wake up which was really waking me up at the right time. So I guess it works for some people, but for me it didn't and I am sad because I got a wonderful experience with Zeo head band which is now out of business.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"1024px\"\n    }\n  }, \"\\n      \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"span\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n    \"href\": \"/static/726f5f102ab98005201063eb6bc3fb31/2bef9/sleep-1024x500.png\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    },\n    \"target\": \"_blank\",\n    \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n  }, \"\\n    \", mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"48.666666666666664%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"alt\": \"sleep 1024x500\",\n    \"title\": \"sleep 1024x500\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/726f5f102ab98005201063eb6bc3fb31/2bef9/sleep-1024x500.png\",\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/726f5f102ab98005201063eb6bc3fb31/5a46d/sleep-1024x500.png 300w\", \"/static/726f5f102ab98005201063eb6bc3fb31/0a47e/sleep-1024x500.png 600w\", \"/static/726f5f102ab98005201063eb6bc3fb31/2bef9/sleep-1024x500.png 1024w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n    \"decoding\": \"async\"\n  }), \"\\n  \"), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The chart is having the same problem than the heartbeat one.

After re-reading, I finally see the message on the left saying that accordingly to my plan it should be between 6:15 and 11:00. I do not understand why not in the afternoon. So I ended up by removing that habit, and just use a walk habit in the afternoon. \", mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"1024px\"\n    }\n  }, \"\\n      \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"span\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n    \"href\": \"/static/941e3f6b5c73b578e77c889e91c9041e/2bef9/lightexposure-1024x692.png\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    },\n    \"target\": \"_blank\",\n    \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n  }, \"\\n    \", mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"67.66666666666666%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"alt\": \"lightexposure 1024x692\",\n    \"title\": \"lightexposure 1024x692\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/941e3f6b5c73b578e77c889e91c9041e/2bef9/lightexposure-1024x692.png\",\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/941e3f6b5c73b578e77c889e91c9041e/5a46d/lightexposure-1024x692.png 300w\", \"/static/941e3f6b5c73b578e77c889e91c9041e/0a47e/lightexposure-1024x692.png 600w\", \"/static/941e3f6b5c73b578e77c889e91c9041e/2bef9/lightexposure-1024x692.png 1024w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n    \"decoding\": \"async\"\n  }), \"\\n  \"), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Habit can be paused but it is not obvious.

This is great and they are still improving like they just added the possibility to control your music with your Band. The user interface is confusing on the phone and on the website. I have the feeling that both teams needed to ship something to show the data as fast as possible, and the result is what we see. The interface is lacking of options, you need to go in a lot of different places to get your data for example if you want to see your heart beat you need to go in Calories or Steps screen. Also, you will see plenty of spinners when loading graphs when it's the first time you access the data. Nevertheless, the art on the website are great. Lot of graphics, some SVG animations which are cool and most of the configuration are accompanied with great cartoon illustrations. Even if the color are not yet harmonized across the website, we see some experimentation and improvement coming in and out. The website looks alive and give the impression that they are working in the right direction to have the best experience possible. They have thought to have different view on every page depending of if you are interested to see a daily view, weekly, monthly, etc. Soon, I will try to develop with the SDK and write again my impression. I am already really exiting to see what we can do with the Microsoft Band 2.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3147b0f3-e442-5a60-8338-aeb512f26a69","slug":"2016/microsoft-band-2-website-and-phone-ux-problems","__params":{"slug":"2016"}}},
