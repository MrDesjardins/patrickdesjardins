Let's start with my context. I have been working with databases for more than 15 years and also working with the web for 20 years. While a lot of students were expressing their difficulties with some assignments that needed database or web knowledge to accomplish the primary goal, I was fine. However, in hindsight, it should have rung a bell. To be able to spend under 15 hours per week, you need to understand at least half of the topics or master assignments technologies before debuting the semester. For example, in the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"network security\"), \" class, one assignment was using Wireshark, the next one a MySql/PHP database/website and another one a Chrome extension in less than two months. I am not even talking about the nitty gritty details of having to know different languages (Java, Python, etc.), libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib) and environment (virtual machine, Ubuntu). In the database class, there was a considerable amount of the final assignment directed toward building a PHP website which is not needed to evaluate database knowledge. It was not a predicament for me, but you can foresee that it could be a burden to add on top of a lot of new theories. The factor of serendipitous knowledge to have gathered play a significant role in the grade. However, this is not the worse. The worse is that satellite knowledge plays a vital role in your success. Even fast learners will feel strain because while learning the main subject, the numerous homework, assignments, and projects on top of the exams appear as obstacles instead of learning vehicle. The rapid pace impeded a full understanding. The numerous tangential topics, not well weaved together, constitute in mixed knowledge that looks like a bag of feeble crumbs -- ready to be blown away on the next gust of subject. Riding on a slight understanding and moving on and forget what you barely explored to try to catch the next train is the modus operandi.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Instructors Do Not Teach\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My third class was \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"machine learning for trading\"), \".

There is absolutely no way that the words used by the instructors would be accepted in any workplace I have been working. When students ask questions, you can bet to read a scathing response. An example of a reply: \\\"You know it in your heart\\\" is a classic of one of the instructors instead of answering. The responses disincentivize people who misconceive subjects and would like further explanation. The public humiliation of receiving a stark reply stem, in some classes, the propagation of anonymous question (which is possible with the system) or simply in my case demotivate to ask a question.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The lessons recorded could be condensed by half or with better more thorough examples. Most of the lessons are full of pleasantries which sway the main topic out of attention and also increase anxiety because you want to understand but you keep having an instructor taking the subject lightly.

You can imagine the sound and video quality.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Finally, the instructors refer regularly to whitepapers. Not as a complementary explanation but as a way to avoid providing a thorough explanation in the lesson. I acknowledge that delivering clear explanations require a considerable amount of preparation but I entail, by joining a top 8 University in the USA, to not be deflected constantly toward whitepapers. Swimming in new concepts and having someone referring that the remaining of the information is in a whitepaper (and insinuating that students already have read them), is a lack of professionalism and it makes student losing track of the lesson. I found not educational to stop the lesson and to jump into these scholar papers, which takes hours to read instead of taking a couple more minutes to explain the essential parts.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Interaction on the Student Forum\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"This is a good segway into the type of questions. Most student will ask questions in the school's student forum called \\\"Piazza.\\\" Most questions are on the assignments and not on the lecture or reading.

Most of the time, \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"students\"), \" were answering me. The instructors and TA (teaching assistant) were absent or focusing on the assignments. Many TA couldn't respond properly, either. An example, I took the time to screen grab a portion of the lecture asking why the instructor was mentioning an increment of +1 in a formula and after more than four messages the TA was saying that I could use anything. But, when I challenged him about why the lecture was explicitly using +1 or if I can use any constant, the TA was answering me that it would be better to have decay. I still couldn't get an answer about the +1. I understand that the ratio of TA/students is enormous, and they are overwhelmed to grade assignments, but I was expecting more. I'll skip some frustration with the delay on getting grade which does not help to give you a pulse if you are working on the expected way. In most courses, you will get your grade for the first assignment once you have submitted your second, hence could not really apply the feedback from the former on the latter.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As briefly mentioned in this section, what astonished me the most is that questions are all related to assignment not the lecture or the books or papers to read.

During my machine learning semester, I jumped throughout the session between 55% and 96% in my grade giving the same amount of thoroughness. The change was different TA was grading me. Also, even if I was answering every requirement there was always a place to subjectivity about that I should have discussed furthermore on different tangential topics. I noticed similar grading fuzziness in other classes where the report has an unclear requirement. Asking clarification on the assignment does not result in iterating on the assignment requirements but to many scattered posts in the student forum which make it hard to follow. I also found that it penalizes student that was not last minute. Many time, a clarification was changing the meaning of something and I had to re-write. Furthermore, asking for re-grade is heavily skewed to make you fail even more. In two of the four class, they had a blank statement that a request to re-grade would lead to a penalty if they deem that it is not justified.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Time Invested\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I finally withdraw my fifth semester because of the arrival of my new child.

These lectures are highly recommended but because the explanation is more detailed. However, it is from another school.

The additional stress of not having any base to start or any clues was un-educational. I agree with struggling to learn and working hard but not to ferment in limbo waiting to salvage pieces of information from a flood of questions asked by different and lost students. What was worth the majority of the points with the growing misunderstanding of the topics stirred with the lack of sleep led me to take a break. While the time invested every week varies greatly depending on if you read and watch all the material there is also group homework that can play for a big factor to increase the charge.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Team Assignments\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The value of teamwork is often undervalued, however, is inadequate for a remote master program. The outline is that people are spread across different timezone. The variance between each individual in term of skills can be considerable.

And, the classic burden of teamwork where half of the team is doing everything and the other half just wait is influencing quite a lot the time you will invest every week.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The first two courses I took had team works and I got lucky to have people with more or less 3 hours different timezone and also found people who were not last minute. In one of my team, one guy was almost 12 hours difference influencing my choice of also communicating with him before my daily work. Nonetheless, consolidating family, work and school is already a challenge. Teamwork is adding an additional layer of difficulty. It makes the idea of flexibility out of the equation if you are diligent in your assignments.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Flexibility\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One aspect of online school is that you have control of the time you want to study. But, the reality is far from being flexible. All the course I had, so far, was giving so many homework (up to eight), with additionally many projects (up to three), with a mid-term and final exam. And, most works require prior reading; hence, when you schedule all that needs to be done you are entirely on a rigid schedule. The critical path of success is on a thin line where shifting a couple of days is possible but increase the backlog of work later.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Also, most assignments are not in a final state when delivered. I had several graded works being in a draft for several days, and then being amended during the short allowed time to perform the work. The fluctuation of requirement disrupt people who like to start ahead. I am someone who likes to start and finish as soon as possible and got bitten often by assignments that were changing throughout the weeks hence favoring people working late. The result is that you have barely any room of flexibility. Once again, if you add that you need to schedule with many teammates, then you are simply in a corset with a low room to breath.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Quality of Content\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Concerning the quality of the content, it varies but mostly poor. You can see it by yourself because most are available on Youtube. The problem is, depending on the instructor, you will get a lot of low production quality classes. Audio is often poor, examples borrowed from books, calculus are skipping step making it hard to follow, many jokes that make the week lecture up to 3 hours (the recording varies between 45 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes but if you take notes it will go up to 3 hours). My main complains is that in 2019 we have so many good quality content for free on Youtube that Georgia Tech must level up their production quality with the aim to teach instead of just covering a topic. For example, covering a critical algorithm (I already forgot the name) in less than 5 minutes video is a blasphemy. Also, there is a lot of variation on the notation used compared to the whitepapers which might be accurate but very confusing for a neophyte to decipher whitepapers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The lecture were made not with student trying to learn in mind. For example, when the instructor is writing formula, often, they will in post-production cut the time when the instructor is writing -- it fast forward into the end of the writing. It forces the student to pause the video when taking note. Thus, the lecture are most of the time taking way more time because of all the time we need to pause. In real classes, student can write at the same time of the teacher, or take time to digest the message before moving on. Not that time, this responsibility is on the student. Furthermore, in real class, you can raise your hand to ask a question, get unblocked and being able to continue to follow. With recorded lecture you can only continue to watch and ask later in the student forum, or search online. The disconnect does not seem harsh for someone who understand but for someone not getting a specific key point in the theory can cause to not master well the remaining of the lecture. I am autodidact and found myself in few situations not totally sure about what the instructor meant. If the instructor is using personal jargon then you are on yourself to find out what it really mean because Internet will not be helpful. Relevant to the format of the lecture, because they were recorded many years ago without alteration, unclear passage remains unclear. In traditional lecture, the teacher can learn from the questions of the student and clarify next time this one give the course.

The concent could fit under 30 pages in letter format. It was a summary of the lecture. In my perspective, it reflects the quality in the sense that there was a lack of diligence on how useful was the recommendation.

But why? Because Georgia Tech courses are built in a very bumpy way. The lessons start slow, with (too many) jokes and then get shallow on many topics and then dive very deep in calculus, so much that you have a hard time to grasp concepts because of all the shortcut taken and references to whitepapers to finally get back very into a totally different aspect of the main class.

The paucity of example provided by professors/instructors in the content lead to dry land of application. Fears drive students to stop asking a question or helping others. In the end, the only benefits are the TA who are grading the same assignments every semester because they do not have to change the requirements.

My experience is that you cannot rely on these because the time is mostly the wrong one for your life. For example, in one class, the time was while I was at my job and the other one in my commute back home. That being said, they are recorded, so you can listen to them later with the disadvantage that you cannot ask questions or clarification. In reality, I watched twice a recorded TA/instructors video because they are a very slow pace. Usually, the modus operandi is that the lead will introduce all the TA then read the Piazza questions and try to explain something.

Their answers are that they already work in the domain, hence understand most of the theory and only need to ace the work, or it was that they had another class that was similar and could relate better what was needed. Finally, the answer is that the \\\"grading curve is generous\\\" meaning that I could continue to walk head down and get a low score (as 40%) and be able to get a \\\"B\\\".

A shortcut justified by letting students focus on the analysis but it is a sign that students lack the knowledge to complete the task. Instructors decide to employ different learning shortcut instead of guiding the student from the base to ground up. The issue is that the affinity between the classes is not well defined. A well-tailored program in machine learning should guide the student into several logical and ordered classes that go from the base to something complex. Instead, each class is distinct without any relation (and can be taken in any order which is confusing).

Again, Georgia Tech is a top university and should have a system that guides users to thrive instead of delegating. I already mention that Georgia Tech delegates to whitepapers for depth in concept, and to other online videos for the poor quality of their own, they delegate to other books for the limited examples provided and now they delegate how to manage student curriculum to students.

His contribution might be stellar in the research community does but is not a prerogative to teaching and acting poorly. Georgia Tech has a feedback system only available at the end of each semester.

Also, one additional flaw of the course is the level of example that is often none or a single one taken from a whitepaper or book which is merely a requirement to understand. To alleviate these problems, clearer lecture with clear materials instead of having a list of +20 white papers would help. Creating a set of examples with step by step explanation where newcomer could consult and experts could skip is not a genius idea -- it is what you get when you try to understand who consume your service.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Additionally, aiming for a maximum of 10 hours per week for a neophyte and testing that assumption would make the program available for an adult with a family and a daily job.
