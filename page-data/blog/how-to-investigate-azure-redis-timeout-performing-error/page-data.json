So, I'll try to give some of the steps I did to figure out my problem. My problem might not be like yours, but I didn't have any problem locally. Problems started to surge when I deployed in production on Azure. My setup was pretty basic with a Standard Web App (S1) and the smallest Azure Redis instance (C0). Even by upgrading to a Azure Redis instance (C1), which is quite more powerful I was still getting Redis timeout performing error.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Before continuing, I read that the C0 instance is just for testing purposed and not for production. The size is 4x bigger, this wasn't an issue for me but I realized that I was hitting the 250mb limit which was producing Redis to remove items from the cache. This wasn't a major problem in my case. The biggest change between C0 and C1 is the Megabytes per sec (MB/s) that go from 0.625 to 12.5megs. This is 24x faster. It also handle 12000 request per seconds which is 2x more than C0. In my case, I kept the update even if it didn't fixed the issue.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The second modification was to change the number of thread. By default, Redis uses the same amount of thread to the amount of processor that the web server is running. A S1 instance is single core, thus was running on a single thread to send request to Azure Redis. This is problematic because requests queues and time out. To change the amount of thread, you can set the value in your \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Global.asax.cs\"), \" in the \", mdx(\"inlineCode\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Application_Start\"), \" method.

To fix this problem, two actions was successful. The first one was to serialize with a max depth. I'll write a future article about how to modify Json.Net to serialize a limited amount of deepness. This is critical if you are using Entity Framework because reference can be very deep. The second solution was to compress the data sent to Azure Redis. I'll also write a future article on how this can be implemented. In short, I am compressing every objects sent to Redis using LZ4 encoding. I am getting a very fast compression that cut around 75% of the size. Here is the result in kilo-bytes of the same data with theses 2 changes. The result is stunning.

More a job takes time, more it has chance to access data on the cache. I added a lot of log and realized that my serialization was still taking some time before accessing Redis. Two solutions was possible. One is to serialized less deep and the other one is to do some parallel operation when setting. To have less serialization deepness you need to trick Json.Net (I am using Json.Net). This can be done with a ContractResolver that count the number of level the serialization goes. This is crucial if you are using Microsoft Entity Framework because references go very deep with object. I found a sweet spot at 5 level deep. The performance improved by 70% in average. The parallel was quick to do, but has a drawback of using the same thread as the web, hence it impacts more the front-end. Microsoft recommends to have your heavy webjob on another web instance.

The second drawback is the possibility to bring back some Redis timeout since we do a lot of call to Redis. The third drawback, which made me rollback that change is the one mentioned right before the code snippet : the web was getting slow.
