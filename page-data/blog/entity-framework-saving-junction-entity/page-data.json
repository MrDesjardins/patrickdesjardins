By the time we save, the contest is not yet saved (when it is a first save) and therefore not possible to set the contest's id correctly.

Then, we hardcode the _Market_ to _unchanged_. This is because we know for sure this one exist and do not want to add any new of this entity. Finally, the _Contest_ is set with the same state of the contest itself since we know that they are the same entity as the one saved. The code in this article is not full because in the case of modification, we would need to delete all the collection first.
