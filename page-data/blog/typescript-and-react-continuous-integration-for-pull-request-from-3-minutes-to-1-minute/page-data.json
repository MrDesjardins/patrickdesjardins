I personally like to have on every pull request a build that makes sure that everything is building and not only on my machine as well as my unit tests to be run to make sure that no regression is introduced. For several months, this process was taking 3 minutes +-10 seconds. This was satisfying for me, it was accomplishing its main goal. I was expecting some time because of the nature of the project. First, I am using TypeScript, seconds I am using node modules and third I need to run these unit tests. The code is relatively small on that project.
