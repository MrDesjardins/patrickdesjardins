It became clear that a departure from software engineer to machine learning expert would be a rough transition. As the semesters advanced, a sour taste tainted the experience to grow in the AI world. The program lacks depth and fails to foster an environment to carry students in their professional success. I estimate that the valuable information can shrink the four years of 20 hours per week to a single year. Furthermore, the return on investment is better if you focus on each topic you want to master instead of zooming on unnecessary domains that each class was a culprit to different degrees. The strong tendency of overwhelming students with offtopic requirements, off-loading explanations to whitepapers, and mirroring quantity of work (assignments, lectures, exams, projects, quizzes) for quality are a few elements of many that tarnish the education system - Georgia Tech is not different.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"On the positive side, I want to say that I respect people having a full-time job, a family, and pursuing the program.
