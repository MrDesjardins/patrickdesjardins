Trying to balance both without disrupting my family was time challenging. Before Covid, I would go to work around 6h30am to start school until around 8h00am to then work. Then, family time and school in the evening. But, this year, I had to bring my younger one to pre-school, so my morning routine was family and then work. Once at work, I found myself working more hours. I worked until dinner time instead of finishing once my \\\"time was up.\\\" Blocking time between work and dinner did not work for me: often, I found a reason to continue what I was working. When I had to work on school for the evening, I barely had an hour with my wife.

Outside adding features, I started to migrate (slowly) some code out of Redux to rely solely on the Appolo client. The complexity of normalizing the data and having the life cycle with Redux was not always apparent for all the engineers and was also time-consuming. I like separating the logic from the user interface, but it costs. For GraphQL, Netflix is moving toward having services having their own GraphQL services instead of gRPC/Rest; hence I took under my wing the responsibility to migrate our big NodeJS GraphQL server to be Federated compatible, and we will slowly in 2022 have many GraphQL servers serving data and extending our current NodeJS server. So we are moving into a federated world.
