There are multiple reasons for this, the main reason being reusability. You can reuse these components regardless of the lifecycle. They are not tied to Redux or any other framework you may migrate to in the future. The second reason is simplicity. It is simpler not to be dependent on the store for testing.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The second type of component is the container component.

That\\u2019s right; if every component hooks to the store, any change to the store will notify every component instead of just a few select ones that can then distribute the changes down. The flow is more predictable if it goes top to bottom than every component getting notified. That being said, a balance is required as well. Otherwise, too many components will have a huge properties list or have a very high-level property which makes them access too many values, thus confusing developers what they should access.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Loading Page\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Everything starts when a page is loaded.

Saving a value in Redux fires an event that the data in the store has changed which then notifies all the components that are listening to the store. The chain of reaction is fine, but I\\u2019d rather not have a component start the process of the data fetching. The first reason is that a component should be very dumb. The mounting of a component which only performs display and dispatches operations does not necessarily mean that we want to fetch the data. A change in the route, on the other hand, triggers the need for new data. Therefore, in this architecture, the loading of data is driven by a custom middleware that looks at the route change and executes the proper calls that will fill up the Reducer.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Business Logic\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Business logics are the core of your system, especially when it is more than just a CRUD application where we take data from the server and throw it on the screen.

Normalizing the data means avoiding any duplication of data inside the store even if the data is used in many branches. Normalizing should always be done before sending the data to the Store.

Avoiding duplication is key to a stable system where the store is a source of truth.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Pre and Post Middleware\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Every time an action is dispatched, the lifecycle flow of information goes from React component to middlewares to reducers to the store which then notifies the React component.

This middleware can dispatch many actions. For instance, it can set the active entity by looking at the URL, dispatch a \\u201Cloading\\u201D action for a particular set of data, and deconstruct the URL to know if a whole page is changing or if the URL is for a deep link which may require different actions to be dispatched.
