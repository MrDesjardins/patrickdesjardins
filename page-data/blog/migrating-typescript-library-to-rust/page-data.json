The scope ownership, borrowing, and dereferencing add a layer of thinking that distance you from your goal of making features.

Where go Rust remains a good question. I see potential when you do not want to install a heavy virtual machine that Java requires while remaining cross-platform. Rust is also a good replacement for C++ as it helps avoid memory issues. However, as of 2023, many high-performance jobs already have a set of skilled C++ developers and for more business-oriented backend have strong Java developers who like popular frameworks like Spring.
