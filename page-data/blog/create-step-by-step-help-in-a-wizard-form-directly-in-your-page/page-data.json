This open source library is still maintain by Linked and allow to assign html box with an arrow to specific Html. The library is great but is in JavaScript. If you are working with Asp.Net MVC, you may want to have something that will generate all the JSON for you and also put the help trigger only if the current page contains help. This article will show you a way to do it pretty easily.

This one contains a CSS file, a JavaScript file and some images. Once you add all those files into your solution you have to alter few of these files. I usually do not like to alter third-party code because it is hard to keep with the next versions, but this time you have no choice if you want to keep your code with the MVC framework (content and script folder). The first modification was with the CSS file that was expecting the image to be on a sibling folder. This is not a big deal if you do not care to have image next to CSS folder. However, the bigger change that must be done is in the JavaScript file. This one need a new public function to add the next element. This is required because the library setup all the wizard's steps when the page load.

The HelpViewModel class is the one that contain codes about the HopScotch JavaScript. This is the class that the Html Helper later will use to generate the JSON object and the JavaScript call. It contains the tour id which is something unique. This is used in the case we use multiple page HopScotch wizard which I do not plan to use. This is why I just generate a random id. The list of steps are every help box. Each one contains the title, the description, which element to link to and also JavaScript action if required. Other than that, this view model can set some JavaScript action when we start the help wizard, stop this one or end it. The difference between close and end is that close is whenever the user stop using the help and end is only after every steps are done. \\n\\n```csharp\\npublic class HelpViewModel { private readonly string tourId;\\n\\npublic HelpViewModel() { tourId = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(); this.Steps = new List<HelpStep>(); } public string TourId { get { return tourId; } }\\n\\npublic List<HelpStep> Steps { get; set; } public JRaw OnStart { get; set; } public JRaw OnClose { get; set; } public JRaw OnEnd { get; set; } public string StepsJson { get { return JsonConvert.SerializeObject(this.Steps ,Formatting.Indented , new JsonSerializerSettings{ContractResolver = new CamelCasePropertyNamesContractResolver()}); } }\\n\\n} \\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In this code, few things worth to stop by.
