It is a medium size reading of 6 hours 21 minutes. The book begins with the perspective that everyone is an artist and to transform fears into curiosity. There is the notion of performing something every day for 15 minutes. Procrastination is seen has three folds which are that you do not care or that the goal is a shadow goal which means that you have no joy executing. The second fold is that it might not be the right time to accomplish the task. Finally, procrastination might be a sign that the task build-up fears. I could resonate on the last point. The solution is to acknowledge the fear and to see the task as fun experimentations where failing is okay. In the end, having this attitude let you go through and most of the time success will be there. There is an allusion that most of the time small details appear more prominent than they are and to illustrate this idea the picture of looking back to something that was stressful might surprise you that what was causing the fear was more significant than it was in reality.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The book is a series of small tips to change the perspective when motivation become the culprit of moving forward. From basic idea like breaking down an idea into small chunks, to taking the time to ask \\\"does this matter?\\\" are proposition.
