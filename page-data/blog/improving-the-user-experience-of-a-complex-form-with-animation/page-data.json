One form allows to configure the BGP Configuration. It was present in the legacy portal. I found it complex to understand and while many users are well aware of how BGP works, some other partners have less knowledge. I am a strong believer that a user interface must guide the user to avoid writing bad information and then being alarmed by a red error message. My philosophy is to guide the user during the data input and make the experience enjoyable without fear of bad action or wrong inputs.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"While I was learning how Netflix's caches worked and how BGP was supposed to be configured, most people were drawing a diagram. Since the \\\"human to human\\\" natural explanation was to use simple graphical geometrical shape to explain the concept, I decided to not fight that natural behavior and to embrace it.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The first step was to produce a simplified version of different kind of sketches I received and to generalize the idea from several different states the BGP can be configured. The configuration in the old system was two forms for IPv4 and IPv6 which required the user to have a mental picture of the configuration not displayed. I decided to combine the two to avoid the user to open two browser windows (or tabs). I also wanted to avoid a completely new form per use cases. For example, a BGP configuration requires hops between the gateway and the peer when the gateway is not on the same subnet of the peer. The peer IP is configurable, hence can change which may or not have the hops count in an instant.\\xA0\"), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"display\": \"block\",\n      \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n      \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n      \"maxWidth\": \"908px\"\n    }\n  }, \"\\n      \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"span\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n    \"href\": \"/static/b13f848c1fc8b4de40fc36517fe95406/a2b88/image.png\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    },\n    \"target\": \"_blank\",\n    \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n  }, \"\\n    \", mdx(\"span\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"50%\",\n      \"position\": \"relative\",\n      \"bottom\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\",\n      \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n      \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n      \"display\": \"block\"\n    }\n  }), \"\\n  \", mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n    \"alt\": \"image\",\n    \"title\": \"image\",\n    \"src\": \"/static/b13f848c1fc8b4de40fc36517fe95406/a2b88/image.png\",\n    \"srcSet\": [\"/static/b13f848c1fc8b4de40fc36517fe95406/5a46d/image.png 300w\", \"/static/b13f848c1fc8b4de40fc36517fe95406/0a47e/image.png 600w\", \"/static/b13f848c1fc8b4de40fc36517fe95406/a2b88/image.png 908w\"],\n    \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"width\": \"100%\",\n      \"height\": \"100%\",\n      \"margin\": \"0\",\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n      \"position\": \"absolute\",\n      \"top\": \"0\",\n      \"left\": \"0\"\n    },\n    \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n    \"decoding\": \"async\"\n  }), \"\\n  \"), \"\\n    \")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"BGP Configuration with IPv4 and IPv6\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The screenshot above shows a configuration.

The hops are between the gateway and the peer. Also, you can see the gateway IP moving to the gateway which is not anymore the same as the Peer IP.

It was built using React, TypeScript and basic normal HTML. No SVG, no canvas. Working with SVG is trendy but it overly complex for even basic styling. For example, adding a drop shadow.

Like I wrote in the performance article, I never had a dedicated task (or time) reserved to make this feature with animation -- I had to do it. The more I work in software engineering, the more I realized that it is very rare that you have time for extra. This unfortunate rule applied for user interface extra, for performance tweaks and even for automated tests. You must find the time, squeeze these little extra between bigger initiative and always have some buffers for issues which could be used if everything went smooth into some polishing. In the next bug fix, I plan to improve the colors and how smooth the animation happen on slower computer, but this is story for another time.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"id":"3ca083ff-1521-526f-a370-b19ea5bc40d7","totalPages":70}},
