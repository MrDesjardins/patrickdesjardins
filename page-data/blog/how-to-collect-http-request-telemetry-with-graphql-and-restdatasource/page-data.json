I am always keen to have insight about what is going on. While I created from the ground-up the GraphQL server with NodeJS I had in mind to find a way to give me, the software engineer, some insights by providing some direct feedback in the bash console running the server but also to send the data to an ElasticSearch cluster. Before rendering or sending the telemetry, we need to collect it. In this article, I'll write how I proceeded to get information on individual HTTP calls that the GraphQL query invoke to retrieve the information while resolving a graph of objects.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The solution is oriented toward the library RESTDataSource but it is exactly the same principle with Axios or other HTTP request library. The idea is to subscribe to a global event that is invoked when a request starts and when a response comes back.

The first one is to generate a GUID that will serve as a unique identifier. It is added into the HTTP header. Then, the second action is to add in the GraphQL's context a collection of HTTP requests.
