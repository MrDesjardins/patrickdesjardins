The concept is that the developer of a structure that can be iterable abstracts how to navigate the data outside the data structure. The logic of traversing the values is outside the iterable structure: it lives inside an iterator. The power of the design pattern is that a single iterable object can have many ways to traverse the data. For example, we could have on a list (iterable) one way to traverse from the first element to the last one (one iterator) and another way to travel from the last element to the first one (second iterator).
