Most of the time, we see that we can check the information inside the Setter (which in C# is the SET of a property). This is interesting and personally my favorite way to do it. The main reason is that you never have any model object in a dirty state which could fail on future use. My second reason is that it's easier to control what goes in the model. Everything that goes into the object has to pass through setters and this way, everything is clean inside the model.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In my last two years of development, I had to do development with Silverlight few times and also had the use Asp.Net MVC which pushed me to use a different approach. Instead of using setter to validate input, I had to use a custom function to do it. Not that Silverlight force you to validate outside the setter, in fact, it's still easier in my opinion with the MVVM pattern to use setter to handle exception and business rules from setter. In fact, the modification was that most of those project were already started this way, and second is that sometime, you need to validate stuff that has interdependency. Let say that you have a \\\"Car\\\" class which need to have special rule concerning the Color depending of the Type of this one. This mean that you need to set every time the Type before the Color. Also, with ORM that load your object directly, you may come in some situation where this one, doesn't load your object in the right order for properties which will raise error.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In the same time, Asp.Net MVC encourage a lot to not validate directly with the setter. What motivate me to like more and more the validation outside setter is that Microsoft has implemented since the first version of ASP.Net MVC the ModelState that handle all errors from the model binding, to annotation validation in your model to your own business logic error. This is built-in. This mechanism is used by the model binding to let you know if something has not be binded correctly if you use the automatic model binding. Here is an example of automatic model binding.\"), mdx(\"pre\", null, mdx(\"code\", {\n    parentName: \"pre\",\n    \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n  }, \" public ActionResult Edit(Car car){... \\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \".Net framework let you add you own error into the model binding.

The \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"IsValid\"), \" function will return true if nothing has been added to the ModelState and will return false if Model Binding error occur OR if you have business logic error.

What's about validation that need to be done inside the action of the controller. This could be that maybe we do not want any one to edit a car that is not available. This require a call to the database and of course won't be inside the model object. The controller can be a good position to check.

For partial view, no problem, everything will be stored in the ModelView which contain a dictionary of all error during the life cycle of the request to the server. The Ajax situation is not really more complex because the Ajax call will call the action method which will store all error in the ModelState. The action method will return a JsonResult for most of the time which contain, for most of the time, a partial view in a string that will be injected into a Html div.
