The reality is that the maintainer of a GraphQL service must provide a set of acceptable inputs. The rational is that GraphQL needs to query a services or any source of data in a known way. For example, if the REST endpoint takes an ID to fetch a specific entity, it would not make sense to take for input the NAME of the entity -- the service does not support it. The explicit behaviors of GraphQL is a major difference compared to SQL (Structured Query Language). With the Graph Query Language, the requested fields inside the graph is flexible but not the inputs.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In this article, we will see how to create a query that take an input that can be used by an HTTP request against a web service in REST.

The resolver sole tasks must be to take the decision about which endpoint to call and ensuring the data is cached and structures as expected and not to handle how to create the Ajax request (or SQL queries, or gRPC request).
