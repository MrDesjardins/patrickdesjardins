This column includes 4 of the navigation timing processing step that include mostly the network call. It includes redirection, if the fetched resource result is an HTTP redirect (3xx). It also has DNS and TCP delays. What it means is that it contains all the time before users reach the Asp.Net code. It's the time to translate the domain into an IP address, the time between different hops that separate the user and the machine that host the HTTP server and the time the http request move from the machine to the HTTP server (IIS, Apache, etc). This time tend to be huge if the HTTP server is sleeping. For example, if you release a new version on Azure Website and do not warm the server, the first hit will be slow. This will translate in Application Insights by having the \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"networkDuration\"), \" higher than usual.
