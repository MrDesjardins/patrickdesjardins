An to be honest, their integration is very simple and efficient with a nice C# Api. If you used to just create a new email account in your cPanel and use Smpt, you cannot even find any similitude with Azure -- you must use a third-party tool to send email (or create your own email server in a VM).

A webjob queried the last 15k users per login date to get the emails and sent the email with SendGrid. Withing few minutes SendGrid suspended my account. While this is unfortunate because emails for this good news couldn't be sent, what was drastically bad was that any new account couldn't validate their account : a validation link is sent by email. For more than 24 hours no new customer could reach the system."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"The reason the account got suspended is that that emails were bouncing. That means that email couldn't reach inbox of user. It can be because the email is invalid, the mailbox is full, the email doesn't exist, the server is down, the message is too big, etc. It's hard to have a valid list of email if initially the system allowed to create without having an email validation. It's also hard if once validated that you allow the user to change without validating again."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"SendGrid create a list of all bounced emails. I plan to be pro-active and do a database cleanup of those accounts. A good approach is force user to modify their email on their next login with a validation email to be sent. After x number of weeks, if the user didn't change it, we can delete the account. Regarding any new users, their account is validated on creation, as well when they modify the email in their profile. We allow them to simply be removed from the email list which make them more comfortable to keep their real address in their account."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"What could have been done to avoid that situation?
