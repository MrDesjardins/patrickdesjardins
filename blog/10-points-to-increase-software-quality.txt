9:T468,I've witnessed more than I thought I would team of people building code without understanding the framework they are using or understanding the business. It is impressive that many lines of code can produce a decent number of features without having the creator deeply understand some decisions. Performance issues, errors, or misaligned features are the consequences. To ensure the quality of the software, the organization must ensure that people understand the system they are working on. Clarifying a product can be done by having good documentation, a good onboarding process, a good training program, and a good culture of sharing knowledge but also being available. The rise of AI, bots, or moving support overseas creates new barriers and breaks quick communication. However, because of KPI and financial incentives, in most cases, the management and the engineers run toward pushing lines of code. The quality is lower because the person is less motivated but also cannot work on the best solution because he doesn't understand the system. Thus, it accomplishes some metrics (KPI) that check the box and nothing beyond.a:T5b5,Qualifying quality is complex, and it is easy to lean too much on either side. However, increasing the quality benefits the end users and software engineers. When these two groups of people are satisfied, the result is a win. However, in our modern way of building software, keeping the quality high becomes harder. After years of fighting the system, even motivated people will give up. Some people leave, and some just start playing the KPI game to check the boxes and move on. The problem is that with more and more disconnect between the people building the systems and the software, the more work on these systems becomes a chore, and the more users complain. The saddest part is the people who make these decisions are often already well rewarded (promotion, bonus, position) and often leave the company before the real impact of their decision is felt. Or these people are so disconnected that they do not feel the pain of the users and the engineers. For example, if they are not using the system, they might not understand that it is not efficient to have an existing feature operate in a specific way. Similarly, for the engineering side, if the way something is made makes it hard to debug, then they do not feel the pain, which means it never gets prioritized. Again, the best environment is having people connected to the system, using it, and having their hands somewhat dirty in the creation. The flatter the organizational structure, the better.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"10 Points to Increase Software Quality"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2025-01-14"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"In my career, I have noticed a few details that significantly increase the quality of a software product.

Behind the curtain, the bugs are documented in the tracking system, but there isn't any incentive for people to tackle them until they cause financial loss (or user loss).
