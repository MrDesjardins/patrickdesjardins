9:T56b, class, one assignment was using Wireshark, the next one a MySql/PHP database/website and another one a Chrome extension in less than two months. I am not even talking about the nitty gritty details of having to know different languages (Java, Python, etc.), libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib) and environment (virtual machine, Ubuntu). In the database class, there was a considerable amount of the final assignment directed toward building a PHP website which is not needed to evaluate database knowledge. It was not a predicament for me, but you can foresee that it could be a burden to add on top of a lot of new theories. The factor of serendipitous knowledge to have gathered play a significant role in the grade. However, this is not the worse. The worse is that satellite knowledge plays a vital role in your success. Even fast learners will feel strain because while learning the main subject, the numerous homework, assignments, and projects on top of the exams appear as obstacles instead of learning vehicle. The rapid pace impeded a full understanding. The numerous tangential topics, not well weaved together, constitute in mixed knowledge that looks like a bag of feeble crumbs -- ready to be blown away on the next gust of subject. Riding on a slight understanding and moving on and forget what you barely explored to try to catch the next train is the modus operandi.a:T401, were answering me. The instructors and TA (teaching assistant) were absent or focusing on the assignments. Many TA couldn't respond properly, either. An example, I took the time to screen grab a portion of the lecture asking why the instructor was mentioning an increment of +1 in a formula and after more than four messages the TA was saying that I could use anything. But, when I challenged him about why the lecture was explicitly using +1 or if I can use any constant, the TA was answering me that it would be better to have decay. I still couldn't get an answer about the +1. I understand that the ratio of TA/students is enormous, and they are overwhelmed to grade assignments, but I was expecting more. I'll skip some frustration with the delay on getting grade which does not help to give you a pulse if you are working on the expected way. In most courses, you will get your grade for the first assignment once you have submitted your second, hence could not really apply the feedback from the former on the latter.b:T41c,The grading is also subjective and questionable. During my machine learning semester, I jumped throughout the session between 55% and 96% in my grade giving the same amount of thoroughness. The change was different TA was grading me. Also, even if I was answering every requirement there was always a place to subjectivity about that I should have discussed furthermore on different tangential topics. I noticed similar grading fuzziness in other classes where the report has an unclear requirement. Asking clarification on the assignment does not result in iterating on the assignment requirements but to many scattered posts in the student forum which make it hard to follow. I also found that it penalizes student that was not last minute. Many time, a clarification was changing the meaning of something and I had to re-write. Furthermore, asking for re-grade is heavily skewed to make you fail even more. In two of the four class, they had a blank statement that a request to re-grade would lead to a penalty if they deem that it is not justified.c:T64b,The lecture were made not with student trying to learn in mind. For example, when the instructor is writing formula, often, they will in post-production cut the time when the instructor is writing -- it fast forward into the end of the writing. It forces the student to pause the video when taking note. Thus, the lecture are most of the time taking way more time because of all the time we need to pause. In real classes, student can write at the same time of the teacher, or take time to digest the message before moving on. Not that time, this responsibility is on the student. Furthermore, in real class, you can raise your hand to ask a question, get unblocked and being able to continue to follow. With recorded lecture you can only continue to watch and ask later in the student forum, or search online. The disconnect does not seem harsh for someone who understand but for someone not getting a specific key point in the theory can cause to not master well the remaining of the lecture. I am autodidact and found myself in few situations not totally sure about what the instructor meant. If the instructor is using personal jargon then you are on yourself to find out what it really mean because Internet will not be helpful. Relevant to the format of the lecture, because they were recorded many years ago without alteration, unclear passage remains unclear. In traditional lecture, the teacher can learn from the questions of the student and clarify next time this one give the course. This natural iterative improvement is not present in Georgia Tech because they do not actively work on the content.d:T49f,I was able to assist to a single online "live" video interaction with TA and instructor. For a program driven for "online" education, it is very awkward. The time for these "live" video-chat are supposed to be a time where you can ask questions and to have a discussion but it is more driven by students asking questions in the forum (Piazza). My experience is that you cannot rely on these because the time is mostly the wrong one for your life. For example, in one class, the time was while I was at my job and the other one in my commute back home. That being said, they are recorded, so you can listen to them later with the disadvantage that you cannot ask questions or clarification. In reality, I watched twice a recorded TA/instructors video because they are a very slow pace. Usually, the modus operandi is that the lead will introduce all the TA then read the Piazza questions and try to explain something. Most of TAs do not have a microphone outside there headphone or laptop hence the quality is low. For me, the worse is that every question launch discussion that digresses the main question. 10 questions could lead to 1 hour, and as mentioned earlier, time is scarce.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Georgia Tech Online Master Degree Review after 4 semesters"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2019-06-06"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["I joined ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/","children":"Georgia Tech Master of Science in Computer Science"}]," at the end of 2017 with the idea to expand my knowledge in an area I am interested: machine learning.

I already mention that Georgia Tech delegates to whitepapers for depth in concept, and to other online videos for the poor quality of their own, they delegate to other books for the limited examples provided and now they delegate how to manage student curriculum to students. I'll cut short in the tech-infrastructure pitfalls because this could be a post on its own (they also ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://www.ajc.com/news/breaking-news/breaking-data-breach-exposes-georgia-tech-faculty-students/zAUUNWy5hoHQ8bNvMxcsWL/","children":"leaked student social security number and password"}],").

A process of having someone to genuinely asses the quality of each course should be in place. Instead, I witness that the institution rather close their eyes and pat themselves on the back.

His contribution might be stellar in the research community does but is not a prerogative to teaching and acting poorly. Georgia Tech has a feedback system only available at the end of each semester.

Also, one additional flaw of the course is the level of example that is often none or a single one taken from a whitepaper or book which is merely a requirement to understand. To alleviate these problems, clearer lecture with clear materials instead of having a list of +20 white papers would help.
