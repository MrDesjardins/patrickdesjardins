9:T4b3,That’s great, but what can we get from these numbers? I am not an expert on open source projects, but I can only see that there is more activity around TypeScript. The number of contributors and releases are in favor of Flow. That said, the number of contributors is significant only if they are all active. The number of releases is also subjective since TypeScript cadence is every two months, Flow looks to be faster. Does that mean it’s better or not?This is subjective since the balance between stability and new features is always at play. TypeScript has more forks and more starts than Flow. Again, what it really means is that people are more interested, hence follow the project more and maybe get the code. Does it mean TypeScript is better? I don’t think so. The metric that I was the most interested in is the number of pull requests. It’s a good indicator that features and bug fixes are coming in. Both Facebook and Microsoft have employees contributing to the code, but it’s still relevant. TypeScript has more than 10 times the number of features/fixes coming in than Flow.  So, on the open source aspect, TypeScript is one step ahead because of the language used to build it.a:T5e6,But what does that mean and where is the information about Flow? I have to say that I had an easier time finding that list directly from the TypeScript website as well as some blog posts, which are easier to look up. Flow has the disadvantage of having a name that brings lots of noise in search engines. I did some searches but couldn’t find much and their website doesn’t have a list of partners or use cases. But, does having big names in terms of businesses and projects really matter? It does. First, as you can see, Microsoft has quite a few projects written in TypeScript (or that have been converted from JavaScript to TypeScript). You can see that Microsoft Office (Web), Microsoft Teams and VSTS are using TypeScript. These are applications developed by thousands of developers and used by millions of users. Microsoft won’t switch off easily — it would kill the productivity of many projects and won’t be helping Microsoft. For companies and projects outside Microsoft it means that other people had to make the same decision that you may have to make and they analyzed that TypeScript was the right choice. These projects are used also by a lot of people and the decision to go that way was well evaluated. When Google Angular team decided to go with TypeScript instead of Flow or plain JavaScript, they did their homework. It also means that one of these big companies could fork TypeScript and continue its support or development in the eventuality that Microsoft would change its mind.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"TypeScript vs Flow (Part 1 of 3) - Who are they?"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2017-08-16"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["Most of the time, usually at the beginning of a project, some hard decisions need to be made.

BabelJs has the advantage against TypeScript that you can cherry-pick plugins and presets you want. TypeScript allows you to enable and disable features, but you are limited to the features they release. At the end, BabelJs is very popular and gives more flexibility.

TypeScript offers stage 2 and up feature from EcmaScript because their philosophy is to have all released feature backward compatible (which is true since version 1.0).

TypeScript brings simplicity at the cost of a being a less cutting edge. But what does it really mean at the end?

Indeed, after reading only one article of many, it seems that I am leaning more on TypeScript. I would say that the major arguments in the decision about TypeScript or Flow are in fact in that article.
