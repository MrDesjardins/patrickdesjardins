9:T58a,The construction for each entity that is normalized and denormalized is to have an entity that contains no relation, one that contains the relationship keys, and one that contains the rich objects which will be filled during the mapping to React. For example, if you have "EntityA", the pattern would be to have "EntityA" and "EntityANormalized" and "EntityADenormalized" that inherit "EntityA". During the mapping (and the creation of EntityADenormaliez) you use all the common property from "EntityA" which reside inside Redux's store that hold instances of EntityANormalized and you remove all keys and array of keys to replace them with the other object in the store. For example, if you have EntityA that has a relationship to B, the EntityANormalized have "EntityB:number" which won't be used in EntityADenormalized because this one will have "EntityB:EntityBDenormalized". Once you have these three interfaces created, you can create a EntityA model which contain a 1-1 relationship to the denormalized entity but also can have other data needed in the React component. For example, you can have Routing data, other denormalized entities, or global user's preference data, etc. The fifth interface contains a list of all potential action the user can execute in the component. Finally, a simple interface that extends the Model and Dispatch interface is created and used by the React component has its property.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"How to Organize Model Type with TypeScript and React/Redux"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2018-05-29"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I will not pretend that there is a universal way organized type in a Redux/React application.

A normalized model means that Redux will store only a single instance of each entity in the store -- there is no duplication of data. A normalized model infers that the data will be denormalized during the mapping from Redux store to your React's components. The normalized model will have an id (string or number) instead of having the object. For example, if you have EntityA that has a one-to-many relationship to EntityB, than the EntityA in the normalized model will have an array of EntityB ids, not the EntityB instance. However, in the EntityA denormalized you will have an array of EntityB.
