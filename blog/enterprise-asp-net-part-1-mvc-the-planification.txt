Usually, trainer split every body part on multiple session during the week. So, in 1 week, you can go 4 times to the gym and train with 4 different workout. This is what we call a workout with 4 different session of exercise. Each session contains different exercises. Every exercise contains a name, a number of set and repetitions. It can also contain tempo which are at what time the exercise movement is done. While a set is the number of time you are doing the exercise, the repetition is the number of movement done every set of time. For example, you can have the exercise called \"Leg Press\" which are done 5 times (5 sets) of 10 repetitions (10 reps)."}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"children":"The Model in UML Class Diagram"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"If we try to translate this application into a static UML diagram, like the UML Class diagram we have something like below."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/images/blog/modelClassDiagram.png","alt":""}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"As we can see, we will have user that will be identified by the system which could have zero or many workout.

By that I mean that will will remove the User class and develop everything for a single user for few times.
