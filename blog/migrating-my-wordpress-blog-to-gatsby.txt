wished. For example, the pattern of passing the dates is something to think about since it relies on the build script. Also, you can see that the ",["$","code",null,{"children":"query"}]," variable is not used directly. Gatsby has many default behavior, like this one, that is by convention. By convention, you can have a single GraphQL query that is called during the call of ",["$","code",null,{"children":"createPages"}],". So, when looping the page, it performs a call with the context information. The current date allows not to display blog articles planned in the future. Quick remark here: many things that WordPress offers from many years are not present in Gatsby. Gatsby is not specialized as a blog platform like WordPress. Thus, some manual work is needed. There are many gotchas. For example, you cannot have a GraphQL in the Typescript component, similar to an image that you cannot pass a path to a TypeScript control without error. It is also harder to debug because you need to debug during build time, not during execution time. While you can still debug the TSX for some elements, most of the code is executed only at build time. that being said, I was able to use VsCode to debug the build script without a problem.
