In some situation, you may need to know if the mouse has hit a specific polygon drawn in a canvas. This can be easily done with Silverlight using the `VisualTreeHelper`.

First of all, you need to have a listener to the mouse even.


```csharp
void myCanvas_MouseRightButtonDown(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e) { 
  e.Handled = true; 
  Point currentMousePosition = e.GetPosition(this.myCanvas); 
  var underMouseControls = GetControlFromCoordonate(currentMousePosition); 
} 
```

The second step is to create the method `GetControlFromCoordonate` to return a list of Control that has been clicked.


```csharp
public IEnumerable<Control> GetControlFromCoordonate (Point coordonate) { 
  return VisualTreeHelper.FindElementsInHostCoordinates(coordonate, this.myCanvas).OfType<Control>(); 
} 
```

This will return an enumeration of all UIElement which be cast to have only Control. You can even filter more if you search specific control.

So, the `VisualTreeHelper` may not have a HitTest method but with the `FindElementsInHostCoordinates`, you can filter the result to have the same result.
