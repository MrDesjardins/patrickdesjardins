If you need to go inside ASP MVC code which can be very instructive you just need to hit 3 checkboxes inside Visual Studio and you will be ready to go.

First of all, you need to go on the **Debug>Options and Settings**. This will open the Options of Visual Studio. From the Debug menu, you should already be in the good menu which is **Debugging**.

Select the first sub-menu which is called "General" and uncheck **"Enable Just my code (managed only)"**. Check **"Enable .Net Framework source stepping"** and check **"Enable source server support"**. That's it. You will be able to step into the .Net source code and also set breakpoint inside the Microsoft code.
