If you are developing Asp.Net or Asp.Mvc and would like to have warning or error if you are not using Html5 correctly, it's plausible.

You have to go in Visual Studio 2010 into **Tools>Options>Text Editor>HTML>Validation**. From there you will be able to set up some configuration about how to display messages to you.
