If you are using a grid (third-party) or a simple Html table you may need to have fixed column width but not having the text overlap to the next cell if bigger than the cell width.

To fix this kind of issue, you may want to add 3 dots after a certain amount of character. This can be done automatically with CSS3 and it's called ellipsis.

\[css\]

.yourGridClassName td { white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis } \[/css\]

The _white-space:nowrap_ is used to make sure that even if space are present that nothing will be warped under neat. The _overflow:hidden_ make the text not overlapping to the next cell or outside the table. Finally, the _text-overflow: ellipsis_ add three little dots to indicate that the text continue but has not space to show.
