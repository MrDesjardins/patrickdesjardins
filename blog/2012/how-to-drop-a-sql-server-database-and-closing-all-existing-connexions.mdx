Simply executing DROP [YourDatabaseName] won't work if previous connection are already made. You need to alter the database to set it to single user and rollback every other connection. Once dropped, you can create back your database. When creating the database, the default value is to set to multi_user so you do not have to worry about setting the value to single_user with the alter.


```sql
 IF EXISTS (SELECT name FROM sys.databases WHERE name = N'YOURDATABASENAME') alter database YOURDATABASENAME set single_user with rollback immediate DROP DATABASE YOURDATABASENAME GO 
```


If you do not do the alter statement, you may have the error : "**The database could not be exclusively locked to perform the operation.**"
