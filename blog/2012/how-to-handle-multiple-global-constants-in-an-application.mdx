The best way to have something organized and having constants in a single place is to have a class that will have inner class. This way, you can organize by theme your constants.


```csharp
 public static class GlobalConstants { public static class Division1 { public const string Const1 = "123"; public const string Const2 = "qwe"; public const string Const3 = "asdfgh"; }

public static class Division2 { public const string Const1 = "123"; } } 
```

Of course, it's always better to have your constant in the class that they are more related. For example, the default value for a specific property of a class should be directly inside this class. But, for global constants that are used across the application, than having a global constants class can do the job.
