If you are using the Data Annotation with Asp.Net MVC you might need to localize the message from these annotation.

Here is an example:

\[csharp\] public class Person { \[Required(ErrorMessage="FirstName is required")\] public string FirstName { get; set; } //... } \[/csharp\]

If you want to have the Data Annotation translated in many languages, you should use two others properties that are : **ErrorMessageResourceType** and **ErrorMessageResourceName**. This will let you specify the resource type and the resouce name which is the key of inside the resource file.

\[csharp\] public class Person { \[Required(ErrorMessageResourceType=typeof(MyResourcesNameSpace.ResourcesFile), ErrorMessageResourceName="FirstNameRequiredKey")\] public string FirstName { get; set; } //... } \[/csharp\]

This way, you will have your application localized from the Model to the View without any problem.
