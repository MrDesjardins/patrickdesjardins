It's rare that I am writing about third party control but Telerik grid has a new feature that is kinda hard to find any way to implement. If you want to insert a new row to a Telerik ASP.Net MVC grid that you need to add a call to the method **InsertRowPosition**. This can be done inside the method **Editable** of the grid.

\[csharp\] @Html.Telerik().Grid<YourObjectType>().Editable(e=>e.InsertRowPosition(GridInsertRowPosition.Bottom)) \[/csharp\]

This is a short snippet of code to demonstrate how to add a row at the bottom of a grid with Telerik Grid.

Of course, to the button to add a new row you need to use the ToolBar method to add a command to insert. This is done by adding **ToolBar** method to the Telerik().Grid().

\[csharp\] .ToolBar(c=> c.Insert().ButtonType(GridButtonType.Text)) \[/csharp\]
