You may come into project that has resource file that are not linked with their designer file. [![](http://patrickdesjardins.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ResourceNotGrouped.png "ResourceNotGrouped")](http://patrickdesjardins.com/blog/?attachment_id=1300)

The cause is simply that the custom tool has been removed. You only need to set it back and the resource and designer will be linked.
