You can migrate your EF4.5 to EF5.0 without the need of Microsoft .Net but if you use some features like the support of `enumeration` that provide EF5.0 you will need to have the .Net Framework 4.5.

What does it means? It means that you need to have Visual Studio 2012. So a simple migration of Entity Framework 5.0 became an endeavour of few hours but at the end work well.

I think it worth it if the business you are working on accept to change their tool (VS2010 to VS2012).
