This morning, I started a new project where the team use IIS Express instead of Visual Studio Web Server or IIS. For me, it's new. Even if I have developed for several years with Visual Studio, I always used Visual Studio Web Server (Cassini) or the full IIS.

The install of IIS Express is quite simple with **Microsoft Web Platform Installer** and can be easily configured by Visual Studio (in the property window of the project) and from the configuration file inside the IISExpress folder of your My Document.

> Unable to launch the IIS Express Web server

This happened when the project was launch. After checking if the port was blocked, check if projects were correctly compiled, I decided to remove IIS Express completly. I have to say that IIS 7.5 was installed and once the problem occured that I tried to install 8.0 over it. So, everything got uninstalled and I installed everything from scratch. I also did not use my team mate configuration file (which were edited to point to the correct path). I also installed directly IIS Express 8.0 and decided to let Visual Studio on the first launch to create the Virtual Directory with a new configuration file. From there, everything worked.

I suggest you to start uninstalling everything, remove the configuration file from you My Document folder, re-install and let Visual Studio on the first launch create everything.
