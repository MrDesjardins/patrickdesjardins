The ",["$","code",null,{"children":"node_modules"}]," from the developer computer are not being mounted to the container. The reason is that we want the container to have its own node_modules; it is pre-installed at build time, cached, and also on the right OS. If your Docker container is Linux and your developer machine a Windows, you wouldn't want to have the Docker container to mount your Windows dependencies in your Linux docker container. Hence, we anonymize the folder. The anonym tricks go along with the ",["$","code",null,{"children":"WORKDIR"}]," change to ",["$","code",null,{"children":"/node/app"}],". As you saw earlier in this post, we are installing the NPM module in ",["$","code",null,{"children":"/node"}]," on the Docker's container and then moving one folder higher at ",["$","code",null,{"children":"/node/app"}],". Then, we mount the developer machine source code into ",["$","code",null,{"children":"/node_app"}]," and then hide the ",["$","code",null,{"children":"/services/frontend/node_modules"}]," from Docker. Thus, Docker sees your TypeScript files, CSS, HTML, etc. but not the node_modules. Node and NPM work because if a folder cannot be found, it searches upward. It means it looks into the ",["$","code",null,{"children":"/node/"}]," folder with a ",["$","code",null,{"children":"node_modules"}]," from the Docker's build step.
