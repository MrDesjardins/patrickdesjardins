The more I work in software engineering, the more I realized that it is very rare that you have time for extra. This unfortunate rule applied for user interface extra, for performance tweaks and even for automated tests. You must find the time, squeeze these little extra between bigger initiative and always have some buffers for issues which could be used if everything went smooth into some polishing.
