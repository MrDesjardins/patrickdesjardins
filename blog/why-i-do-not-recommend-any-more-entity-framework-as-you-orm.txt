9:T554,If you follow that blog or know me than the title may shock you a little. Even if you do not know me, you might think I am crazy. Entity Framework (ef) is THE framework used in enterprise and it THE Microsoft's ORM. It is not that I haven't try to like it. I posted dozen and dozen of articles. Being a user before usable version (before version 4.3) and still a user today. For those who do not know me, well I am the one that fix EF every place where it does not work. It seems that this is a trend wherever I go. People at some point do not figure out what to do with EF and I can make it works. So, in the final, I guess I am not too bad. However, since few months, I have been using EF with a larger scale application and for a long time and I cannot handle it anymore. To give you some context, I have not a simple CRUD application. It has above 100 entities that has a lot of relationship between them. Sometime even circular dependencies. I am using in that project Unit of Work as shown by Julie Lerman and it is wonderful in theory and I still recommend that approach, but not with EF. I am also using, in this particular project, ID field in addition of the object property for foreign key, this way I can null the property and only use the ID has a key, well when possible. This is considered the "easy" approach with foreign key with Entity Framework.a:T492,Let's start with migration tool. This is great. I can launch with few key strokes my development database, seed some values. Same thing for my integration environment where I have some transactions that rollback between test the changes. This is great. The problem is that the script generated by migration tool sometime just does not make any sense. The quickest way is to kill all migration scripts (c# generated file) and start again. This is really fast but cause problem if you have a database with already some data. You also do not have any more the Up and Down methods so it is impossible to come back to a previous version in the case that you need to rollback to fix a bug. Of course, you have the workaround to reuse the file used in your source control, but well... also, the seed is awesome if you have a blank database, otherwise, welcome trouble and maintenance cost goes very high. Again, I am not talking about some simple CRUD application that has 20 entities... I am talking about enterprise grade software with a minimum of 100 entities with 10 to 20 properties each. That said, this Migration tool is not what make me not recommend Entity Framework.b:T4d4,The killer argument against Entity Framework is that the DbContext is a mess to work with. If you are using an unit of work, then you have that unit that collect entities state during the DbContext life -- mostly all the Http Request. So you have a Save method, you test this one and it works. You call that method from a different part of your system and suddenly it breaks. You have error about concurrency, about the entity has changed, about entity that try to be added, etc. You try to debug, your figure out that some entity has the property set and the id set, so you want to null the property but the problem is that code after the commit may need this information so you cannot just null properties. You have than several choices. You can divide your model from your entity, which come with a huge cost of mapping. You can get back the entity from the database, which has the cost of having to do additional calls to the database. You can also clone the entity, null the properties and save the clone. This approach is the one taken in my last project. The disadvantage is that you do not have once saved a new entity the ID automatically set into your model class, just on the clone and you also finish to have code like that:c:T42e,The last thing I want to share is that Entity Framework lacks of basic feature like doing an update with a where clause. EF team expect that you get the entity from the database first on an Http Request this way you can ensure that the entity retrieved is really for the user and than you update this one -- this cause 2 database calls. Instead, a better approach would have been to get the data from the Http Request, build your entity with the binding fields of the Html form and save this one with a where clause with the user authenticated. If the entity does not belong to the user than no update is done -- EF could return 0 entity saved. 1 database call. This is one scenario on many that EF does not make sense if every database call is important for you. Which make me think that most of the time people are working on Intranet application when using Entity Framework. This is fine. And well, there is not a way out-of-the-box the set index... how come after 6 version? Oh yeah, EF 7 will work on NoSql database... this is not what we need, we need a solid ORM.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Why I do not recommend any more Entity Framework as your ORM"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2015-06-09"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"$9"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Before starting to enumerate Entity Framework nightmare, I want to say that I am not allergic to EF, just that if I need to start a new project, I will never suggest that ORM.
