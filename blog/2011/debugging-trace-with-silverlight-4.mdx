Sometime it can be useful to get some tracing line when debugging. For quick trace, I usually use System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine method. This is still working with Silverlight. Also, the System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Log method can also log into the Output windows (Under Debug) of Visual Studio.


```csharp
 System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("~~~~~ WriteLine ~~~~~"); System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Log(0, null, "########### Log ##########\\n"); 
```
