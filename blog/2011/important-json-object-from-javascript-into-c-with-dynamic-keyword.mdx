I never really used the **dynamic** keyword in a real application. I did some tutorials but not much.

This week, I got a situation where I was getting from Silverlight a Json object that I did not want to create an object for.


```csharp
 string response = HtmlPage.Window.Invoke("GetMyJson").ToString(); MyObject data = (MyObject)JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(response); 
```

But, I did not wanted to create the MyObject because it was just for transferring data; a simple DTO object. Instead, I used the **dynamic** keyword provided by .Net framework 4.0.

The **dynamic** keyword will be resolved in runtime and this give us the leverage to access property that might not exist. For example, "GetMyJson" function was returning a simple object with 2 properties "Abc" and "Def".

```typescript
{'Abc':'123','Def':'456'} 
``` 


So, in the C# code, I simply called those properties from the **dynamic** object.


```csharp
 string response = HtmlPage.Window.Invoke("GetMyJson").ToString(); dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(response); string s1 = data.Abc; string s2 = data.Def; 
```

This is pretty useful for accessing quickly some data from Json object.
