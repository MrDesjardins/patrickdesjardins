This is pretty simple. In fact, I am writing this because most example show you this :


```csharp
 public object this[int index] { get { return collection[index]; } set { collection[index] = value; } } 
```

In fact, you should return the type of your collection. So, if your object contains a collection of _Person_ than you should write :


```csharp
 public Person this[int index] { get { return collection[index]; } set { collection[index] = value; } } 
```

This way, the value returned doesn't require to be casted.
