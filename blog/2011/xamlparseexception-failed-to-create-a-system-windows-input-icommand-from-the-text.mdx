> XamlParseException: failed to create a 'System.Windows.Input.ICommand' from the text

This error can occur when binding a Command inside a Xaml file.


```xml
 <Button Command="MyCommand"> Click Me </Button> 
```


In fact, the problem with this syntax reside in the way we call the command. The previous example were not using the Binding syntax.

You need to use the Binding keyword.


```xml
 <Button Command="{Binding MyCommand}"> Click Me </Button> 
```


Of course, you need bind to a ICommand property to the desired command.


```csharp
 public ICommand MyCommand { get { return .... } } 
```

Hope this help some body that has this error :)
