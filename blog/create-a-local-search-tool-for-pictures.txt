On top of the data, a simple website that let me query the database of pictures and return me the best match with a link to the actual full quality picture. Before going any further, a word of caution, the idea of this project is not to develop something that will scale, or a stellar code, hence the quality of the code is very average, but workable solution. Everything is developed with NodeJs, TypeScript, Microsoft Cognitive Api, MongoDb and doesn't have any unit tests.

For me, instead of scanning and analyzing my whole hard drive for picture, I will analyze only picture between a specific range of date. At this date, I have 34 000 pictures taken since 2009 (since I met my wife) and in this population 2 000 have been identified with an underscore which mean that I really like them. For the purpose of having a smaller set of search and not having to analyze for too long time I will only use pictures with an underscore. Second, in these pictures, I can stay that roughly 75% of people are my wife, my daughter or me. Hence, I will only try to identify these people and mark others as \"unknown\". Third, I want to be able to know the emotion and what is going on in the picture. This will require a third party service and I will use Microsoft Azure Cognitive API. I'll get more in detail in the article about the api."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Once the picture will be analyzed, the data will be stored in a MongoDB, which is a JSON based storage. This is great because the result of all the analysis will be in a JSON format. It will allow us to query the content to get results to display in the website.
