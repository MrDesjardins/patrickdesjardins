9:T408,Using VSTS helped me to stay focus or at least prioritize my work. I have over 1500 work items at this day. I was using a sprint approach using the Backlog and Board. I was planning about 6 months a head, with 2 months really more seriously. Always the current month frozen to be sure not to over-add. The rare time I finished the sprint earlier, I added more unit tests. I was adjusting work items (user stories and bugs) for future sprints time to time. At the end, I was able to do every user stories expect those concerning option trading and team trading which the legacy system supported that I decided to drop because of their popularity and the time required. My evaluation of the time for each work items was often underestimated by few hours. I always tried to split my work items in task of 1 to 3 hours which was okay until hitting major issue. Also, tests was longer than expected -- all the time. But, sometime, it was the other way around and I overestimated. At the end, I was more underestimated than overestimated.a:T47d,Overall, the problem is the time it took to create a new integration test. The average was 20 minutes. With the new builder system, it's a little bit faster, because of the reusability, around 10 minutes if the builder miss some methods and under 5 minutes when the builder contains what it needs. It is always a little bit expensive because of the need to create code to prepare scenarios. I also had a lot of problem with Entity Framework because of the context which had previous data. If you want to arrange your test, you need different context that the one executing the code and the one asserting. Otherwise, you have some values in Entity Framework's context that interfere the reality of real scenario where data is inserted in different request. Another problem with Entity Framework was that the order of command was different from the code inside the repository which could change how some path was setting values inside Entity Framework. Result could be from DbConcurrency problem or from simply having association problem. I remember that I some point I was taking more time building those integration tests than doing the actual code.b:T47e,My conclusion about integration tests is that they are required. Database can be tricky and it was beneficial to have an insurance that some automated tests was ensuring that values desired to be saved and retrieved was in the state expected. What I would change is, again, stop using Entity Framework. An additional reason why Entity Framework was causing more pain in integration test is that the invocation order for preparing the test wasn't the same as the service layer who invoked the code in test. For example, inserting a user, joining a simulation, creating an order is usually done by different requests, different Entity Framework context and with some logic in the services layer that we skipped in the integration test just to insert the data required. It would have been way easier just to do insert in the database for preparing the test with Raw SQL and then using the repository to read it. I also am sure that I do not need test with a framework that click around the UI. It was planned, but even if the UI is very stable, that would have add an additional layer of tests that is not essential, and very fragile and time consuming.c:T43b, because I do not need to -- the code is simple. It does simple tasks, simple actions and that's it. It modify the active view with JQuery and that's it. The CSS is also very simple, and I am leveraging Bootstrap to reduce a lot of complexity and having the UI responsive from cellphone to website. In my day to day job, I am using TypeScript, with modules, and React. I think this is the future, but it adds a lot of complexity and performance aren't that better. Having the server generating the UI might not be the current trend, but Razor aside I can generate the whole UI within few millisecond (mostly under 50ms). Slower than when it was in PHP, but still faster than a lot of UI I see these days. That said, I really like React and those big front-end framework, I just believe that if you have a website under 20 pages, that is not a single page application with simple UI that you do not need to go in the "trendy way" of Angular/React/VuesJs. I also believe that if you have an intranet website that you should avoid those big frameworks. That said, it's an other subject.d:T709, 1 more night (it's not a single checkbox...), configuring Azure's slots and having to create Redis, delete Redis, etc few nights (you cannot just flush the Redis, you need to delete the instance and it takes a lot of time). I also had to send the database, configure the DNS (which is more complex than Cpanel), etc. Jobs was also difficult because there are so many way to do it. I started with Visual Studio's UI where you can setup with a calendar when each task start, but I needed a cronjob styles of syntax. I tried 2 different ways, the last one worked but still had some issues, needed to create an issue on GitHub, etc. Overall, having everything up and running took me about 3 weeks. I though it would take me 1 week. Overall, I think Azure or any other cloud service is great but most website can handle it with a single VPS or server for way less. I can configure Redis was faster than Azure do without having to pay the enormous monthly cost. For a corporation, the cost is justified since you might cut on IT resource. However, for small side-project that has low budget (or almost not revenues after paying servers and other costs) it can squeeze you even more. Azure is also changing quite a lot in some area, and in other it's stale which you never know if what you are using will still be there in 5 years or you will be forced at some point to update SDK. In my legacy Linux VPS, I can have everything ran for a decade without having to worry about it -- it just works. Azure is great, I do not regret since I learned a lot, but I didn't fall in the happy-wagon of not seeing that it doesn't fit every scenario. I also miss the feature of being able to configure email like in CPanel with Linux. It was literally taking 2 minutes to create a new email's box. On a final side note, e:T717,Lot of great things happened during this project. The user of VSTS was definitely a good idea. It was hosting my source code, doing my build and organizing what I needed to do. All these features for free. The use of C# was like always a delight. Asp.Net MVC was also a good choice. While Razor will never been what it should have been in term of performance, the syntax was a pleasure to work with. Three years ago, there was no way I would have started that project differently. Right now, if I had to redo it again, I would aim more for a Single Page Application (SPA) with TypeScript and the new Asp.Net Core as the backend (which just get released to be usable for more serious project). That said, I wouldn't redo that project, at least not for a new decade. Handling more than 50 tables, more than 988 classes, 95 interfaces, 5736 methods is a little bit too big to learn about technologies without finishing the project with already a lot of already out of date. While I really believe that a project need to be bigger than just a dozen of entities to feel the reality and not just an illusion of that frameworks and libraries can do, handling too much just create a burden. I still have a lot of good memory about MySql and PHP. PHP is not as pretty as C# but it was pretty quick. MySql was also very great and easy to work with. Sql Server is more robust and has more features but I am not using most of them. Concerning speed, I haven't see a huge different. One thing that worry me is to be lock down to Azure. I could move into a Asp.Net server, transform those webjobs into services and be on IIS, but at that point, I know that I can get better with a Linux, Apache server. The situation is changing with Asp.Net Core and will reduce that feeling since it would be possible to use any kind of server.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Post-Mortem of my Asp.Net MVC Project, SQL Server, Redis and managed with VSTS"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2016-11-23"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["During winter 2014, I decided to re-write my old 2004 PHP stock simulator.
