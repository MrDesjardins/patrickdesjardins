9:T5be,The composition of the outline was carefully done with a primary text for each slide. The writing is required for me since I am not fluent in English like in French. It helped me to have a better idea how to structure my thoughts. I did this step in parallel with the code, and I added to each slide the code file name. The link between the outline's lines and the code allowed me to go back and forth in change and still be clear when it was the time to build the slide to add the right code with the correct text. The creation took me about two months which I estimate to about 50 hours of time for 60ish slides. I added, modified and removed slides. In the last few weeks, I removed about six slides on topics that were too advanced or harder to grasp for people that never developed with TypeScript. My philosophy was not to confuse but rather to inform. Learning the slides by heart took me about one month. It is easier when you build them to memorize the content. My slides contained almost only code and a title, so it was easy to forget the primary goal or example. In the end, I knew all the slide and could visualize them along with the text. Few days before the event, I had spent about 80 hours. The time includes all the rehearsal which are quite long on a speech of 45 minutes. I was able to split in two the speeches and often practiced only the first half. I also did several rehearsals in my car while driving to and from Netflix -- optimizing my time!a:T438,Shift organizers did a great job by booking all the planes, taking care of the hotel and the transports. I had nothing to think else than the presentation. I arrived at Split, Croatia, Wednesday evening very late. I barely visited, just enough to grab something to eat and sleep. The next day, my presentation was in the afternoon. I was very tired, slept and went to see the two presentations before me. I went backstage and got briefed rapidly. I went on stage about 20 minutes earlier because of a shorter speech, but it didn't bother me. I went on stage and I was able to perform my whole presentation in time with two minutes remaining. I forgot some explanations, few examples and looked slightly too much on the screen but overall, I am satisfied with my performance. For some reason, I forgot few slides in my head. I could find many excuses but that wouldn't change a thing. What I take from this experience is that a lot of preparation is needed for 45 minutes. I would do it again in the future but this is definitely many months of work with always something to tweak.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"My Preparation and Experience of Shift Conference in Croatia"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2018-06-07"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["One morning in late February this year, I received an invitation to present at ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://shiftconf.co/","children":"Shift Conference"}]," which is the largest developer conference in Southeast Europe.
