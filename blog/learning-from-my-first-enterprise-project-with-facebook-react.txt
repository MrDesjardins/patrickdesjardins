9:T483,I played with React in 2015 during a Microsoft hackathon. It was without any application architecture like Flux. It was a first experience that didn't impressed me. The page I created was a Visual Studio Team Services hub extension that had some textboxes, combobox, graphics and information were pushed through SignalR. The hackathon was 4 days of development and like anything new, some ramp up was needed. Nevertheless, it was working at then end with a sour taste in mouth. I couldn't really find why I wasn't in love with React since everybody seemed to love it so much. Argumentation about having a clear separation between component and logic didn't make a lot of sense since we could do as well since many years, with some rigor. I also found that this argument is a weak one since you can create messy code with React too and have logic in the component. In any cases, I didn't touch it since this spring with a new project in Visual Studio Team Services where I would need to design the whole page in React Facebook. This time, I wanted to leverage as much as possible and went with an application architecture that was a mix of Flux and Reflux.a:T40e,I am a strong believer of automatic tests. React helps but like any framework this can be a mess too. Since we respect the architecture and all logics are in the actions creators and business logic classes we are able to unit tests easily. It still requires some skill to have proper tests that are easily maintainable as well to create classes and methods small to have not too much to stub, but this is like any framework, not just React. Our strategy is to have > 90% coverage on action creator and business logic. We have a good coverage on classes mapping between the server contracts and our store/model classes. Store is tested to be sure information that is sent by action are stored at the right place. The priority is business logic classes, action creators, stores and components. Components are really dummy and tests are longer to test. Since we can easily see the end result on the browser, we do some minimum tests. Of course, we would like to do tests everywhere but reality is that we need to ship software at some point.b:T4da,The experience with React can be frustrating. It adds a lot of overhead. Typing in a text box raise a full cycle. You also need to have a lot of boilerplate to do to for each new section that are complex (new Flux cycle). Most thing could be more easily done with just changing the UI with JQuery. However, that often lead to some more spaghetti code too. That said, we often forget that most website are not generating billion like Facebook. React is great, but not for small application. Not for small intranet website. It's good for intensive UI that change a lot with different kind of source. I also find that the time to get started with React is higher than just doing plain TypeScript with JQuery, that most people know. The integration of React in this new page was good, even if the rest of the application wasn't React. This is a great news if you have a legacy software and you want to modernize it slowly. React and its different application architectures (Flux models) help to have good practice of dividing your software, but any good architect can also divide an application with any technologies. I understand why it's popular with the virtual DOM, but like I said, most website doesn't need to have a high frequency updates.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Learnings from my First Enterprise Project with Facebook React"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2016-08-16"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"$9"}],"\n",["$","h1",null,{"children":"Application Architecture a.k.a.

Also, beaware that we are using TypeScript so it's more than just single NPM command to get the boilerplate for a new project. I decided to take a simpler approach that doesn't need much and that could be done in TypeScript with just React and React Dom library. It ends up being Flux and Reflux. Flux because we are using Action Creator, and Reflux because we do not use Dispatcher. Why Action Creator? Because we wanted to have all business logic, call to the server with Ajax to be made not by the UI component, neither the store.

Properties that are calculated shouldn't be in the class because they might use logic that make the object being modified in some situation (like with date). Methods are bad for two reasons. First, no one should call them else than the Action Creators. You can hide them by having an interface but the problem is just delayed. It's delayed because if you need to clone the object, the methods won't be copied and you end up with just data without prototype methods.
