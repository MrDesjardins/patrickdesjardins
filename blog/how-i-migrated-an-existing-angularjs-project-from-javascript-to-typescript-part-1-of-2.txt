One argument was that many projects were built in JavaScript, so bringing a new tool to the mix would create a disparity amongst the fleet of repositories we need to maintain. This is a valid argument when we have many different languages like Java, C#, C++, Python, but is it when TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript? No that much since going with TypeScript allows you to still work in JavaScript if desired. Coming back to JavaScript from TypeScript is allow smooth since you could always transpile into EcmaScript 6 and work from the output. Nevertheless, it's an interesting exercise to demonstrate how to migrate an existing AngularJs project from JavaScript into TypeScript. This also may be a good argument to switch to TypeScript since it's easy and bring all the power of strongly typed language and still be very close of JavaScript."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Before going any further, let's see what kind of project we will migrate.
