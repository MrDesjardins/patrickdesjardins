9:T438,I am still interested and will continue my journey of learning Rust on the side. I'm on Rust slowly as I am not actively professionally working with Rust. Rust is in a peculiar situation where Java monopolize a considerable part of the market for backend application with C# for a company that are more Microsoft-centric and C++ for the high-performance situation. Where go Rust remains a good question. I see potential when you do not want to install a heavy virtual machine that Java requires while remaining cross-platform. Rust is also a good replacement for C++ as it helps avoid memory issues. However, as of 2023, many high-performance jobs already have a set of skilled C++ developers and for more business-oriented backend have strong Java developers who like popular frameworks like Spring. The steep learning curves do not have the advantage of developing Node backend (using TypeScript/JavaScript), which also happens to have the benefit of sharing code between the front-end and backend. Thus, Rust remains interesting, but its place is undefined from my perspective.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"__className_aaf875","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_container__Tovb9","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"layout_siteTitle__k5U8g","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"layout_navLinks__mf70r","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkItem__1L8fB","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPictureContainer__XC7nK","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"layout_blogTopPicture__RJHNN","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"layout_main__mXTwS","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"My experience migrating TypeScript libraries to Rust"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostContainer__WYELx","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostDate__LUvx5","children":["Posted on: ","2023-02-16"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I recently migrated a couple of Rust libraries from TypeScript using a subset of features of well-known TypeScript libraries.
