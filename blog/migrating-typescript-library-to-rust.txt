9:T43b,I am still interested and will continue my journey of learning Rust on the side. I'm on Rust slowly as I am not actively professionally working with Rust. Rust is in a peculiar situation where Java monopolizes a considerable part of the market for backend applications with C# for a company that is more Microsoft-centric and C++ for the high-performance situation. Where go Rust remains a good question. I see potential when you want to avoid installing a heavy virtual machine that Java requires while remaining cross-platform. Rust is also a good replacement for C++ as it helps avoid memory issues. However, as of 2023, many high-performance jobs already have a set of skilled C++ developers and for more business-oriented backend have strong Java developers who like popular frameworks like Spring. The steep learning curves do not have the advantage of developing Node backend (using TypeScript/JavaScript), which also happens to have the benefit of sharing code between the front-end and backend. Thus, Rust remains interesting, but its place is undefined from my perspective.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"My experience migrating TypeScript libraries to Rust"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2023-02-16"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I recently migrated a couple of Rust libraries from TypeScript using a subset of features of well-known TypeScript libraries.

While Rust can infer, you need to think twice about type that you do not in TypeScript/JavaScript. For example, a ",["$","code",null,{"children":"number"}]," needs to be defined, whether it is signed, and what size. A question that you do not need to think about. Similarly, using ",["$","code",null,{"children":"str"}]," or ",["$","code",null,{"children":"String"}]," (and then you will read string slice) is a question in Rust. It is correct, but coming from other languages can add more delay to producing something since you need to think twice to some details that you do not have in some other situations. Also, each type can be ",["$","code",null,{"children":"mut"}]," or not.
