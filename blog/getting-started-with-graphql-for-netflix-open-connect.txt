It started in 2012 and was released publicly in 2015. GraphQL is a query language that allows fetching information in a custom way. A traditional REST endpoint responds with all the information defined by the endpoint. GraphQL allows selecting which field.

The services endpoints type can be of REST or ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://grpc.io/","children":"gRPC"}]," -- GraphQL blends the different technologies. The abstraction is possible by configuring the GraphQL server to query on multiple endpoints. The consumer is shielded from details of the backend implementation. It means that a user can query for an entity one day, and in the future keep requesting with the same query without having to worry if the backend changed from REST to gRPC. The GraphQL layer that disguises where the response fields come from one source or several sources. This veil allows improving the backend without impacting the frontend which increases the velocity of the consumer and maintainer of the services."]}],"\n",["$","h1",null,{"children":"Why using GraphQL?"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["The main reason for using GraphQL in the perspective of my actual team at Netflix is having a multitude of services that belong to a single realm. There are many cross entities among our tools (scripts and web applications) and many repetitions.

A collateral benefit is the reduction of API services."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["The second reason is to start ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"using the same schema for entities"}],". Instead of duplicating different version of the same data, we could have a single source of truth owned by the expert of the information and have the client entity generated by the architecture. It is possible to generate entity schema from Protocol Buffer (gRPC’s data structure), to GraphQL, to TypeScript for example. A unified schema would remove mismatch, simplify engineering mental models to a single one and allows a single dialect when talking about a part of our business models. Furthermore, we could reuse entities, mock entity, and unit tests."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["A third reason is the flexibility that GraphQL provides by exposing all the information in a non-opinionated payload independently of the backend sources.

The centralized source of information that is strongly typed increase the discovery of information and provide a living documentation by identifying which entity related to which one. It is even possible to use an online portal (playground) to query live information to reduce the learning curve by interacting with the data directly. The playground can be open and allows custom queried in an interactive and real-time way without having the consumer to install or having a deep knowledge of our business domain."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["A sixth benefit is the ",["$","strong",null,{"children":"reduction of service endpoints"}]," consolidation. When requesting information from multiple services, there is always a stitching of the information to create a workable domain of objects. The duplication is spread across all our web applications. With GraphQL, the multiple requests are executed on the server side, consolidated in a single place and returned. The maintainability is improved by having a single place to modify, the productivity is increased by removing duplicated effort among our consumers."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Many other advantages exist that might not be appealing at in short term.

This is not an issue because we can deploy on the server the Apache server that will redirect all HTTP requests to NodeJS. Having Apache as the front server wrap NodeJS for the security. NodeJS will not be accessed directly outside the machine and only Apache will be able to communicate with NodeJS.
