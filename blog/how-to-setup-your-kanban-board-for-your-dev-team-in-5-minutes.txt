9:T4c2,This dialog contains many options and they are not ordered especially in the order to create a new board. What you want to do is skip all the Cards options which you should define later. Click "Columns" under "Board" and let's change it into a flow that worked for me in the past as well as now. The first column to change is "Approved" for "Specs/Investigations". This column will be the first step and used by your project manager or by your engineering manager to specify which work is getting details about them. This is also good for bug which will get there to be in investigation before having a coded fix. This column is also having the special option "Split column into doing and done". This will result of having the column divided in two. The first part will be where someone commit working on it, and the other one is when the investigation or specification is written. This way, engineers knows that they can pick work from the column, not before. Having this column make it very clear when something is ready to pass to the next step and this is a must in teams that work fast and in an agile way. Anything in that column should be always pickup from top to bottom, whoever is available to grad new work.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"How to setup your Kanban Board for your Dev team in 5 minutes"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2017-05-03"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"We are using VSTS at Microsoft Teams like many products at Microsoft. A few weeks ago, I decided to change our process of using the backlog as main view by using the Kanban board. As you may know, I worked for many years in VSTS and it feels so natural to have a quick glimpse of the Kanban board to know how everything is going. The reason is multiple but the main one is it was hard to figure out the state of each members. It was also hard to have a distinct view about what the front-end and the back-end team were working on. The last real benefit for me is that we do not need to waste time to evaluate every requirements and bugs, we just sort them in order of priority and blitz them through. In this post, I'll give you a short way to build a Kanban Board that work for developers."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Starting with the Kanban board is not obvious.
