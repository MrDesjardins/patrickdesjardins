There is a natural feeling that lockpicking a door or forcing an entry is hard, but when you put some effort into it, you realize that many security devices can get around by looking at other angles than the main one.

Outside TV's shows where cartoon characters use a chimney to get inside the house, it is rarely used in real life to get inside. Thus, the home's security system never focuses on that entry vector.

Sometimes you can be lucky and have access to Brew, and you may have access to Github, but surely you have access to NPM or Cargo, which are library repositories of code.
