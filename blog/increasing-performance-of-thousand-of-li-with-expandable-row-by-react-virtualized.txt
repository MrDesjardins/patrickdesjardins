9:T442,There are a few options. The easiest one is to only display a subset of the whole collection of data. However, the solution penalizes users who may want to reach that information again in the future. A second popular option is to render only what is visible. It means that we need to remove from the screen elements that are hidden, out-of-range of the user. Everything above and under the viewport is removed. The challenge is to keep right the scrollbar position and size. Using a virtualization library that calculates the number of element out of the viewport and simulates the space while avoiding generating too much element is a valid solution. It works well with a fixed row. However, in my use case, I have the possibility to click the row which expandable this one with many inputs, graphs, and text. I also didn't use a table, so I wasn't sure how it would work. At my big surprise, not only variable row's height is supported by the most popular virtualization library, it also supports a collection of an element that is not a table (for example UL>LI).
