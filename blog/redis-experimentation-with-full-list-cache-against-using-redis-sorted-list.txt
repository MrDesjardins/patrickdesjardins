9:T515, in average. The key was determined by the type of list, by the filter attribute and the page number. For example, "MyListOfObjectXXX_PartitionYYY_Page_1". The speed was interesting for me, I was aiming around 100 ms but I was satisfy with the result. The time also contains the time to deserialize the object to create a generic list of all 20 results. I count the deserialization process time in my benchmark because I was counting the ORM time to instantiate the object too. My concern with that solution is that every object can change its value at any time. The value does change the rank by consequence. Since I am also caching the data with a separate key for each instance, I duplicate this information in the cache. The size of the cache can be a problem in the long run, but the bigger problem is that the information become desynchronize. In fact, the source of truth is the individual cached version in the system. It looks like this : "MyData_Key_1". I set an expiry because this is not the real source of data. I will not invalidate that data like the rest of the software when values change from the entity. I will let them expire and than change it. It means that a user that drill down from the list can get an up-to-date data. This is the cost to pay (so far) for a one minute delay.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Redis Experimentation with Full List Cache against using Redis Sorted List"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2015-10-15"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["I am improving the performance of a system right now with ",["$","a",null,{"href":"http://redis.io/","children":"Redis"}]," and the library ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis","children":"StackExchange"}],".

I double check everything because it wasn't making any sense to me. My initial hypothesis was that this was highly optimized for this kind of scenario -- I was wrong. However, the fault is not Redis. After some investigation, I found that the serialization, done with Json.Net library, got some harder time deserializing 20 times a very complex objects than a list of 20 objects. This is mostly because when serializing a list, if the complex object has already a reference that this one is not serialized again but use a reference system.
