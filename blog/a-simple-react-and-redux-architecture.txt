These do no connect to Redux – they get their data from their properties and display it. When needing to take action, they dispatch using the properties as well. There are multiple reasons for this, the main reason being reusability. You can reuse these components regardless of the lifecycle. They are not tied to Redux or any other framework you may migrate to in the future. The second reason is simplicity. It is simpler not to be dependent on the store for testing."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"The second type of component is the container component.

That’s right; if every component hooks to the store, any change to the store will notify every component instead of just a few select ones that can then distribute the changes down. The flow is more predictable if it goes top to bottom than every component getting notified. That being said, a balance is required as well. Otherwise, too many components will have a huge properties list or have a very high-level property which makes them access too many values, thus confusing developers what they should access."}],"\n",["$","h1",null,{"children":"Loading Page"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Everything starts when a page is loaded. React-Router is a key third-party library at this point. Based on the URL that is active, it loads the right component. A pattern we see frequently is to have the ",["$","em",null,{"children":"ComponentDidMount"}]," method call Ajax to load data and then dispatch an action to have the data stored in Redux’s store. Saving a value in Redux fires an event that the data in the store has changed which then notifies all the components that are listening to the store. The chain of reaction is fine, but I’d rather not have a component start the process of the data fetching. The first reason is that a component should be very dumb. The mounting of a component which only performs display and dispatches operations does not necessarily mean that we want to fetch the data. A change in the route, on the other hand, triggers the need for new data. Therefore, in this architecture, the loading of data is driven by a custom middleware that looks at the route change and executes the proper calls that will fill up the Reducer."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"##Business Logic"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Business logics are the core of your system, especially when it is more than just a CRUD application where we take data from the server and throw it on the screen.

The first is the official one from React-Redux which handles the history/location data. The second one is more interesting since it’s the one in which we will manually analyze the route and figure out if we want to load data when a route has changed. This middleware can dispatch many actions. For instance, it can set the active entity by looking at the URL, dispatch a “loading” action for a particular set of data, and deconstruct the URL to know if a whole page is changing or if the URL is for a deep link which may require different actions to be dispatched. In the end, this middleware’s role is to handle the application logic regarding a route change."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"The authentication middleware is the one that can look if the authentication token/cookie is still valid; if not, to request for a refreshed token before continuing the dispatch of action.

Being early in the pipeline, you can block it easily if needed."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Jumping to post-middleware, the most obvious one is the middleware that normalizes the data. This middleware listens to all activities that have a role in saving data to the reducer. It will normalize the data and send multiple dispatches to reducers. I recommend sending one dispatch per entity type since you can have a lot of reducers that are doing different manipulation per type. Since you should have one reducer per entity, it makes sense to have a more granular dispatching process. In the end, reducers will benefit by having a simpler immutability logic that is targeted to the reducer itself."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"The last post-middleware can be a telemetry one where you may want to capture some actions for telemetry purposes.
