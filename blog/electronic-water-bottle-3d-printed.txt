I never tested in any way the bottle and the system. I assumed because I was pushing the DF9 sensor that it would work. The flat surface of the DF9 indicates that any pressure parallel to the sensor would be enough. However, this is far from being true in practice. The pressure on the sensor was significantly greater than that of a full bottle. Modifying the resistor to a higher resistance could help. I started at 10k ohm, moved up to 100k, 400k, 600k, and 1 million ohm. 600 was not bad, 1 million to sensitive going quickly to 100% to 0% (or in term of input 4095 and 0).
