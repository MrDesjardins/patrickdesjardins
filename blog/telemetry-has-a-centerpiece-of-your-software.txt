9:T429,Handling error is one perspective, but knowing how long a user waited to fetch data is as much important. Knowing the key percentiles (5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th, 99th) of your scenarios indicate how the user perceives your software. Decisions about which part need improvement can be taken with certitude because that it is backed by real data from users that consume your system. It is easier to justify engineering time to improve code that hinders the experience of your customer when you can have hard data. Collecting about scenarios is a source of feature popularity as well. The aggregation of the count by users of a specific scenario can indicate if a feature is worth staying in the system or should be promoted to be more easy to discover. The conclusion of how to interpret the telemetry values are subjective most of the time, but is less opinionate then a raw gut feeling. Always keep in mind that a value may hide an undiscovered reality. For example, a feature may be popular but users hate using it -- they just do not have any other alternative.a:T763,There are many telemetries and when I unfolded my plan to collect them I created a TypeScript (client-side) library that is very thin with 4 access points. The first one is named "trackError". Its specialty is to track error and exception. It is simple as having an error name that allows to easily group the error (this is possible with handled error caught in try-catch block) and contains the stack trace. The second one is "trackScenario" which start collecting the time from the start to the end. This function returns a "Scenario" object which can be ended but also having the capability of adding markers. Each marker is within the scenario and allows fined grained sub-steps. The goal is to easily identify what inside a scenario involves slowness. The third access point is trackEvent which take an event name and a second parameter that contain an unstructured object. It allows collecting information about a user's behavior. For example, when a user sorts a list there is an event "sortGrid" with a data object that has a field that indicates which grid, the direction of the sort, which field is being sorted, etc. With the data of the event, we can generate many reports of how the user is using each grid or more generic which field etc. Finally, it is possible to "trackTrace" which allow specifying with many trace level (error, warning, info, verbose) information about the system. The library is thin, simple to use and has basic functionality like always sending the GIT hash of the code within the library, always sending the navigation information (browser info), having the user unique identifier, etc. It does not much more. In fact, one more thing which is to batch the telemetry and send them periodically to avoid hammering the backend. The backend is a simple Rest API that takes a collection of telemetry message and stores them in an Elastic Search persistence.b:T694,The aftereffect of having all the data about the user sooth many hot topics by having a reality check about how really the users are using the system. Even when performing a thorough user session to ask how they are using the system, there is nothing like real data. For example, I was able to conclude that some user tries to sort empty grid of data. While this might not be the discovery of the century, I believe it is a great example that shows a behavior that no user would have raised. Another beneficial aspect is monitoring the errors and exceptions and fixing them before users report. In the last month, I have fixed many (minor) errors and less than 15% were raised or identified by a user. When an error occurs, there is no need to consult the user -- which is often hard since they can be remote around the world. My daily routine is to sort all error by count by day and see which one is rising. I take the top ones and search for a user who had the issue and looks at the user's breadcrumb to see how to reproduce locally on my developer's machine. I fix the bug and push it in production. The next day, I look back at the telemetry to see if the count is reducing. A proactive fixing bug approach is a great sensation. You feel way less trying to put water on fire allowing you to fix properly the issue. Finally, with the telemetry system in place, when my day to day job is getting boresome or that I have a slump in productivity, I take this opportunity to start querying the telemetry data to break into several dimensions with the goal to shed some light about how the system is really used and how it can be improved to provide the best user experience possible.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Telemetry has a Centerpiece of Your Software"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2018-08-14"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["Since my arrival at Netflix, I have been working all my time on the new ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/partner-portal/","children":"Partner Portal of Netflix Open Connect"}],".

The most basic telemetry is a simple log that adds an entry to a system when an error occurs. However, a good telemetry strategy reaches way beyond capturing faulty operation.

The goal of investing time into a telemetry system is to raise awareness of what is going on on the client machine, like if you were behind the user's back.
