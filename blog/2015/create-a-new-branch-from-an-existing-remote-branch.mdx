If you want to quickly works on a new feature without affecting the team's branch or the master branch, you may want to create a specific branch for your work. This is also known as a topic branch. Here are the commands that I use.

```sh 
 mkdir MyNewFeature 
 cd MyNewFeature 
 git init 
 git clone -b teamBranch https://yourgit.git 
 git checkout -b users/mrdesjardins/MyNewFeature 
 git branch -u origin/teamBranch 
 git push origin users/mrdesjardins/MyNewFeature 
``` 

The first two lines create a new folder and move your position into it. This has nothing to do with Git. The next one **create a new local branch** with the specified existing remote branch of the remote server. At that moment, you have the same branch. You need to create a new local branch from that branch. This is done with checkout. Something interesting but not required is to **set the upstream**. Setting the upstream allow to know if the branch you branched from has changed. This way you can synchronize (pull). The last line is **pushing your new local branch to the server**. In that example, the same name so I do not need semi-colon. Otherwise you need to specify local:remove. For example, I could create the local without having the users/mrdesjardins/ and just using MyNewFeature local branch into the remote location users/mrdesjardins/MyNewFeature.
