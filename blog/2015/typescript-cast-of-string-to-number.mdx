The simple task of casting from a primitive type to another can be sometimes easier than we think. If you come from C# you may search within TypeScript the **Convert.ToInt32()** or **Int32.Parse()** or maybe just use **(int)**. None of these conversion syntaxes works with TypeScript. To cast a string to a number, you have to use JavaScript. This means that you can either use the **parseInt** function or to simply add a plus sign in from of your string.

var myInt1 = +"123"; 
var myInt2 = +myStringVariable; 
var myInt3 = parseInt("123", 10); 
var myInt4 = Number("123")

The output of the variables if they are proper number are:

123
(The number of value if the myStringVariable is a proper number)
123
123

If the value are not a proper number, the result will be:

NaN
NaN
NaN OR something else
Nan 

The _parseInt_ can be deceiving. For example, if you try with "123asd" you will get 12 as an answer. However, if you parse "asd" you will get _NaN_. I recommend using the function Number when the base is 10 and to relies on parseInt only if you are working with another base (hex for example).
