We also have seen that it's better to use interface instead of concrete classes because it gives us the possibility to mock later on, give us a layer of abstraction between concrete implementation of the controller and from the repository, mapper and so on. In the next article of this series we will discuss about the repository and Entity Framework in an enterprise Asp.Net MVC web application. We will come back with controller in the article concerning validation of the model. Indeed, the controller will have its role with validation and we will see how to implement a solution that will still respect the single responsibility
