The following code can be added to the DataLoader previously built. Now, the GraphQL invokes the DataLoader of the parent, get the data and populate the parent's cache. Because it has the information about the children, it loops the collection and primes the child's DataLoader as well. The traversal continues and the child's resolver calls the child's DataLoader that has a promise resolved with the child data."]}],"\n",["$","pre",null,{"className":"language-typescript","children":["$","code",null,{"className":"language-typescript code-highlight","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"code-line","children":["children",["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"."}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token function","children":"forEach"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"("}],"c ",["$","span",null,{"className":"token operator","children":"=>"}]," ",["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"{"}],"\n"]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"code-line","children":["      ",["$","span",null,{"className":"token keyword","children":"this"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"."}],"getChildByChildId",["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"."}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token function","children":"prime"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"("}],"c",["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"."}],"id",["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":","}]," c",["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":")"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":";"}],"\n"]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"code-line","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":"}"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":")"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"token punctuation","children":";"}],"\n"]}],["$","span",null,{"className":"code-line","children":"\n"}]]}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"From there, you instantiate the class once in the Apollo's server configuration.
