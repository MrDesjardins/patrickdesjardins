The article goals is to expose your web application on the Internet. We already [explained how to publish with Azure and Kubernetes](./azure-intro-kubernetes) our three Docker images. However, while having the deployements and services up and running, the load-balancer was still not accessible when performing a HTTP request.

# Pre-Requisiste
