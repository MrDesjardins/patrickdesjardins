When you are using TypeScript and React, a good practice is to type your property. Each component is well defined and clear with what to provide. For example:

```typescript
interface MyOptions {
  name: string;
}

export const MyComponent = (props: MyOptions) => {
  // ...
};
```

In React, a popular pattern is allowing the use of children.

```typescript
interface MyOptions {
    name: string
    children?: React.ReactNode;
}
export const MyComponent = (props: MyOptions) => {
  return <div>{props.children</div>;
}
```

You can use several types for the children. The `React.ReactNode` is one that is often used, but also `JSX.Element` which inherently uses the `React.ReactElement`

If you look at the type definition of React you can see that:

```typescript
type ReactNode = ReactChild | ReactFragment | ReactPortal | boolean | null | undefined;
```

and 

```typescript
declare global {
    namespace JSX {
        interface Element extends React.ReactElement<any, any> { }
``` 

They are not the same, but in most cases are almost interchangeable. I would lean toward the `ReactNode` if you have no personal preference has it covers specific, explicit types and has the null/undefined for free.
