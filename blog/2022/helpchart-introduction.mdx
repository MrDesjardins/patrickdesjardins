Kubernetes is a powerful tool that allow you to deploy your servers, load-balancers and other infrastructure with a common language. However, it does not handle dynamic portion in the configuration. For example, you might want to inject a specific Docker image tag or inject an environment variable that change depending of the where the infrastructure is deployed (test/prod). Helm Chart is a templating engine that allows to specify values in a tree fashion into your Kubernetes configuration.


# Installing Helm Chart

On a Windows machine, you can use Chocolatey:

```
choco install kubernetes-helm
```

On MacOs, you can use Brew

```
brew install helm
```

There is plenty of alternative depending of your preference or operating system in [the official installation page](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).

# Getting Started

The first step is to create a Helm. The `create` command creates a folder with many files and folders. My project already have a `Kubernetes` folder, hence I moved into it and used the Helm Chart's create command. 

```
helm create realtimepixel
```
The last word is your project name and also the name of the folder that is created.
