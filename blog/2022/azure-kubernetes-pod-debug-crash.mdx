I had a pod that worked well on my machine but was not once deployed on Azure Kubernetes. It was constantly rebooting with the status `CrashLoopBackOff`. It was impossible to use `kubectl exec -it` on the ill pod: it was always closing and restarting.

However, there is a trick that is not perfect but might help you. The idea is to create another pod and have a `command` telling the pod to sleep.


```sh
# Get all the pods: find the one that is crashing
kubectl get pods -n realtimepixel-prod

# Take the name of the crashing pod and find the image
kubectl describe pod backend-deployment-576495d6f8-nk7rw -n realtimepixel-prod

# Create a new pod from that image and make it sleep
kubectl run debug-demo -n realtimepixel-prod --image=realtimepixel.azurecr.io/realtimepixel_backend:8ee1dadc954c6217270aaea47fbb8118dd3f1170 --restart=Never --command sleep infinity

# Debug
kubectl exec -it debug-demo -n realtimepixel-prod -- sh

# Once done, delete the debug pod
kubectl delete pod debug-demo -n realtimepixel-prod
```

However, the pod does not have all the information from the Helm. In my case, it meant that environment variables were missing. But, you can pass them manually.

```sh
kubectl run debug-demo -n realtimepixel-prod \
--image=realtimepixel.azurecr.io/realtimepixel_backend:8ee1dadc954c6217270aaea47fbb8118dd3f1170 \
--restart=Never \
--command sleep infinity \
--env="IP_BACKEND=backend-service" \
--env="OUTER_PORT_BACKEND=80" \
--env="IP_REDIS=redis-service" \
--env="OUTER_PORT_REDIS=6379" \
--env="IP_FRONTEND=frontend-service" \
--env="OUTER_PORT_FRONTEND=80"
```

I hope it helps you debug your failing pod that keeps crashing at startup. I tested with Microsoft Azure Pod, and it worked flawlessly. I believe it would work on any provider, but always better to clarify under which environment I have tested the debug trick.
