Moving information between threads is always a delicate task. This is because so many issues can occur, and Rust is built around safety; hence it has a safe way to send information between two threads.

One way is to rely on the `futures` crate and use a `unbounded`. The documentation is fuzzy around how to use the `future::mpsc::unbounded,` and I'll try to provide an easy example to grasp the whole idea.

First, before getting too deep with `future::mpsc::unbounded`, know that there is also `future::mpsc::channel`. Channel is similar but is for _bounded_ communication. The _bounded_ has a single channel per sender, while the `future::mpsc::unbounded` has a single channel for every sender. The example uses the `future::mpsc::unbounded` with an internal buffer in case the receiver is not fetching the data fast enough.

# Main Loop Function
The example consists of three functions. The first one, the main one, is the entry one that will spawn two threads.

```rust
fn main() {
    let (broker_sender, broker_receiver) = mpsc::unbounded::<String>();
    task::spawn(receive_loop(broker_receiver));
    task::block_on(send_loop(broker_sender));
}
```

The loop uses `task::spawn` that starts a thread without blocking the execution of the `main` function and starting the `receive_loop` function into a separate thread. It allows getting into the second line that blocks the `main` function to keep the program running while also running a second function, `send_loop` to run into another thread. 

The `mpsc::unbounded::<String>` create a sender and receiver that can be shared between the two threads.

# send_loop Function

The send loop is a function that takes the user input from the command line and adds the value into the `broker_sender` that gets the string into the `mpsc::unbounded` to have the `receive_loop` read it later. 

```rust
async fn send_loop(mut broker: mpsc::UnboundedSender<String>) -> () {
    loop {
        let mut user_input = String::new();

        print!("> ");
        io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut user_input).unwrap();
        let user_input_clean = user_input.trim();
        broker.send(user_input_clean.to_string()).await.unwrap();
    }
}
```

The function has an infinite loop, waiting for the user's inputs. Then, it waits to read the `stdin`, which takes the user line that is all the characters until the enter key is pressed. Finally, the last line gets the `mpsc::UnboundedSender<String>` and `send` the `String` using `await.unwrap`, which asynchronously puts the value into the communication pipeline. It still needs to be consumed.

# receive_loop Function
The last step is the receiving function.

```rust
async fn receive_loop(mut broker: mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<String>) -> () {
    let ten_millis = time::Duration::from_millis(500);
    loop {
        if let Ok(wrapper_msg) = broker.try_next() {
            println!("New message: {}", wrapper_msg.unwrap());
        }
        thread::sleep(ten_millis)
    }
}
```

The function also has an infinite loop. It reads the `mpsc::UnboundedReceiver<String>` where the value is sitting from the previous function. The code above takes the value by calling `try_next`, which returns a `Result`. The function does not look for the `Err` path because the `try_next` spams an error anytime the `mpsc::UnboundedReceiver` is empty. However, when data is ready to be read, the value goes into the `wrapper_msg`, an `Option` type. Hence, the `unwrap` is called to read the string.

# Conclusion

A final observation is that the `mpsc::UnboundedSender` and `mpsc::UnboundedReceiver` shared between the two functions required to be mutable. You can see the `mut` in both parameters. Without the `mut`, the code throws a compilation error:

```
cannot borrow `broker` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
cannot borrow as mutable
```

The reason seems to be that the `try_next` has a `&mut self`  in its [definition](https://docs.rs/futures-channel/0.3.25/src/futures_channel/mpsc/mod.rs.html#1131). From my limited knowledge of Rust, the reason of why the `try_next` seems to be that at the end, it has a queue where it needs to change its value (mutate) with the [unpark_one](https://docs.rs/futures-channel/0.3.25/src/futures_channel/mpsc/mod.rs.html#1031). 


There is a very low amount of examples on the Internet using the `mpsc::unbounded`. I hope these small examples gave you help on how to use Rust Future mpsc to pass information between threads.

The code in this article relies on these two dependencies:

```
futures = "0.3.25"
async-std = "1.12.0"
```
