9:T4d3,Getting definition files is different between TypeScript and Flow. The reason is that Flow doesn't use the same definition file than TypeScript. There is no way to translate one to the other, and both persist their definition files in an independent repository. This creates fragmentation in the community that needs to create two kinds of definition file. As mentioned in the first part, TypeScript has above three thousand definition files while Flow has reached few week ago three hundred. Besides the number of libraries, the major difference is how to get the definition files. TypeScript has a long history of ways to do it. At the time I am writing this article, we are at the third iteration which seem to be stable and better in many ways. It's now using NPM, a tool that every JavaScript developers have familiarity since it is the most common way to get library. It makes sense to have the definition file by the same way. Using NPM allows using the same syntax and configuration file (package.json). This is convenient to store data, but also convenient to get the definition file from a repository that you do not own. By installing with "npm install" you are getting all the libraries as well as all the definition files.a:T427,TypeScript is using a structural typing [6]. Flow is following nominally typing [7]. It means that for TypeScript, if you have two interfaces or classes with the same members but with a different name, hence are a different type, they are assignable. This is to mimic how JavaScript works. However, Flow is nominally typed which means that every class or interface defined is unique and cannot be assigned to another one even if they have the same members. I could elaborate more, but I suggest you read the TypeScript documentation about type compatibility. So who is winning? It’s a hard one. Flow wins if we want something more strict. TypeScript wins if we want not to invent a new language on top of JavaScript. To be noted is that, even if JavaScript doesn’t have keywords for encapsulation and abstraction, the language allow it with closures and other JavaScript tricks. So at the end, TypeScript seems to be the winner since it doesn’t try to change the nature of JavaScript, which Flow is doing…and maybe for the best? I guess that is debatable.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"TypeScript vs Flow (Part 2 of 3) - High Level Coding"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2017-08-23"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["This is the second article of three about differences between TypeScript and Flow.
