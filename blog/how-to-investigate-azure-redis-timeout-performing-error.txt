9:T421,We can see the key prefix with the percentile and the count. 2 of them looks to be problematic even if they are in low volume (16 and 3). It still odd that with 50 threads and multiple pool that these can be problematic, but it was a good indication that some keys were hosting too much value. To fix this problem, two actions was successful. The first one was to serialize with a max depth. I'll write a future article about how to modify Json.Net to serialize a limited amount of deepness. This is critical if you are using Entity Framework because reference can be very deep. The second solution was to compress the data sent to Azure Redis. I'll also write a future article on how this can be implemented. In short, I am compressing every objects sent to Redis using LZ4 encoding. I am getting a very fast compression that cut around 75% of the size. Here is the result in kilo-bytes of the same data with theses 2 changes. The result is stunning. A lot of information is less than 1ko and most of the data is under the suggested limit of 100ko per key.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"How to investigate Azure Redis Timeout performance Error"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2016-08-30"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["There is many official resource about how to ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cache-how-to-troubleshoot/#stackexchangeredis-timeout-exceptions","children":"troubleshoot Redis Azure cache"}]," and ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cache-faq/#cache-performance","children":"Azure Redis performance FAQ"}]," but I couldn't see what was problem.

The biggest change between C0 and C1 is the Megabytes per sec (MB/s) that go from 0.625 to 12.5megs. This is 24x faster. It also handle 12000 request per seconds which is 2x more than C0.

To have less serialization deepness you need to trick Json.Net (I am using Json.Net). This can be done with a ContractResolver that count the number of level the serialization goes. This is crucial if you are using Microsoft Entity Framework because references go very deep with object. I found a sweet spot at 5 level deep. The performance improved by 70% in average.
