This article will be pretty slim but can be helpful for more than just myself so I am sharing. Here are some commands available with NPM that you may not know that can be useful.

To know packages that are installed globally: \[code\] npm list -g --depth=0 \[/code\]

To know where the packages are installed. It gives the global location if no node\_modules folder in the direct folder parent tree: \[code\] npm root npm root -g // The global folder \[/code\]

To know your NPM version and the actual released version \[code\] npm root \[/code\]

To know all available version of a library: \[code\] npm show react-native versions \[/code\]

To get all your direct dependencies current version and latest: \[code\] npm out --depth=0 \[/code\]
