This article will be pretty slim but can be helpful for more than just myself so I am sharing. Here are some commands available with NPM that you may not know that can be useful.

To know packages that are installed globally:

```
 npm list -g --depth=0
```

To know where the packages are installed. It gives the global location if no node_modules folder in the direct folder parent tree:

```
 npm root npm root -g // The global folder
```

To know your NPM version and the actual released version

```
 npm root
```

To know all available version of a library:

```
 npm show react-native versions
```

To get all your direct dependencies current version and latest:

```
 npm out --depth=0
```
