But before choosing the electronics and devices, I needed to find how I could detect a lap. My son and I like the effect of the car \"crashing\" into the rotating lap. So, I started with this idea of having a counter on a rotation. Similarly to web development, adding a debouncer when adding a button would help in case the flap rotates several times. The rotation needs to activate a switch. I thought about having a piece of metal touch two other pieces to create contact, but that sounded somewhat unreliable. After searching online, I learned about \"reed switch\". A magnet activates these. So, I added two magnets (one per flap), and once it crosses the reed switch at the top, it activates the stopwatch."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["The second challenge was to display the time.

However, the problem was the way I broke the piece. First, it is not snappy everywhere. Some connectors (pieces of plastic that go out) were connecting into a female version that was a whole of the same size but with a surround of 0.2mm bigger. That was too much. The lack of experience caused these pieces to move more than expected. Another learning experience was that friction alone is not enough, especially with many pieces. Having a more complex plastic mechanism to snap would be better. This led to the number of pieces: too many. Not only is adding custom clipping time-consuming, but it is also not great when something needs to change. Similarly, the number of pieces complicates assembly and makes it easier for children to break the device."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"I thought of adding screws, but with so many pieces, it would also not be visually appealing. Lastly, the issue was with the wires. There are four wires from the LCD, two pairs of wires for the reed switch, and two wires from the reset button. Then, two wires for the speakers. Passing the wires through the hole is not a good design. Replacing a piece becomes very hard since the wires pass through, requiring the removal of the connection from the ESP up to the device! The design should allow us to snap/unscrew the larger piece, and once done, enable moving the wire without having to pass it through the hole. The arc part, the top one, demonstrates what the whole design should be: a front and back part that snap together. The columns are the opposite."}],"\n",["$","h1",null,{"children":"Electronics"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"The electronic parts worked well on the breadboard, and surprisingly, I had no issue soldering and having everything into the 3D printed device.

Also, it is pretty tight, which could have led to pins touching each other. I decided to crimp the Dupont connector to every wire, and it proved to be a good solution.

I am using OnShape, a parametric CAD software, and I changed a few dimensions which adapted the whole design. Reprinting a few pieces led to incompatibility with prior pieces. The aftermath was some misalignment. While reprinting everything would work, the issue now is that the wires are all passed down, and it is a little bit annoying to re-pass all wires up. Thus, the next step would be to redesign the structure into eight pieces instead of 22, thereby avoiding many connections and holes."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Also, I noticed a few issues with the flap, the magnet, and the reed switch. The flap goes very fast since I added the bearing. I still believe the bearing is required since the plastic-on-plastic was causing a lot of friction, which sometimes was causing the flap to remain in odd positions. In software, I added debouncing and logic that does not count a lap if there are fewer than a few seconds between the last recorded time. However, another issue arises when the flap moves so quickly that the magnet does not have time to activate the reed switch. I am designing as I write a small modification to the flag that will bring the magnet closer to the reed switch."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","img",null,{"src":"/images/blog/FlapMagnetCloserLapCounter.png","alt":""}]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"In the image, you can see the arrow #1 pointing to the reed switch holder, #2 a 1mm spacer that is next to the bearing, allowing a smooth rotation and not plastic-to-plastic friction, and #3 the new addition of 1mm closer to the reed where the magnet will sit.
