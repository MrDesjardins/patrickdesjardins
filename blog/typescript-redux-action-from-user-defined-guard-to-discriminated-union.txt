9:T40b,Redux is all about sending a message from the React component to the Redux store. In the middle, you can manipulate the message sent to middleware. The message sent is called "action". The action contains the payload that can be analyzed in the Redux's flow and transformed to finally be persisted in the single store. A common pattern is to send the payload by using a function that creates that message which is then passed to Redux's dispatch which will send the message in its normal flow. For example, in your React component, connected with React-Redux, you can dispatch a function that returns your payload. The payload should contain a unique identifier and the payload at the minimum. The unique identifier allows middlewares and reducers to know if they should catch the message or just let it goes. The payload is to be manipulated by the middlewares or stored in the store by the reducers. The first approach is, with a user-defined guard, is to create a reusable generic action which will be the envelope for your message.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"__className_aaf875","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_container__Tovb9","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"layout_siteTitle__k5U8g","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"layout_navLinks__mf70r","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkItem__1L8fB","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPictureContainer__XC7nK","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"layout_blogTopPicture__RJHNN","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"layout_main__mXTwS","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"TypeScript Redux Action from User Defined Guard to Discriminated Union"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostContainer__WYELx","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostDate__LUvx5","children":["Posted on: ","2018-02-20"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"Using TypeScript with Redux bring many questions about what really is passing around.
