This wasn't required in the first place and still isn't because of the way the actual project was built -- it was explicitly using the requireJs library in all files. The tsconfig.json also specify what we want to include: .ts file. I added the \"checkjs\" to report errors in JavaScript file. This is not required, but since it's a phase 2, I desired to kick the notch up more in term of validation.
