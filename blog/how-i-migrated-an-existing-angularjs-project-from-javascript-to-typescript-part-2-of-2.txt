This wasn't required in the first place and still isn't because of the way the actual project was built -- it was explicitly using the requireJs library in all files. The tsconfig.json also specify what we want to include: .ts file. I added the \"checkjs\" to report errors in JavaScript file. This is not required, but since it's a phase 2, I desired to kick the notch up more in term of validation. However, the checkjs is limited since it relies on inference or JsDoc comment style which wasn't used in the project that I was converting."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Few changes are required in term of libraries.
