9:T54b,. Zeo is a head band that you have on your forehead during your sleep and it keeps track of your brain activity. Let me tell you that Microsoft Band is really far from being accurate. First, I do not move when I try to get to sleep. So, Microsoft Band think I am sleeping because I am also someone that go very fast with a slow heart beat. Zeo head band can give me 20 minutes while Microsoft Band will give me 10 minutes. The problem is more than that. When I sleep, I know that I have always 2 periods of deep sleep. I have been like that since years and my cycle I just not regular like we would expected. That said, Microsoft Band only find one of those two deep sleep cycle. Finally, since the last half of my night I am only in REM, I tend to move quick a bit but I am not awake. Microsoft Band records these movement has I was awake, so I have a lot of awake period. Finally, the smart alarm take so much time to kick in that I have most of the time the time to wait more than 5 minutes, eyes open before it starts. This is also probably because my heart beat remains very low until I am out of the bed. Zeo head band had also a smart wake up which was really waking me up at the right time. So I guess it works for some people, but for me it didn't and I am sad because I got a wonderful experience with Zeo head band which is now out of business.a:T560,The habit screen is new from few weeks and allows you to specify some reminder. The problem is that the way step to configure habit are located. First of all, the first experience is weird. One item is selected in Sunday. When clicking on this one, it opens a popup where you can select other days. However, you have no clue why this habit is there, neither what to do with it. It's an habit of checking your Microsoft Health. Second, clicking any empty spot (see #2) doesn't do anything. It's natural to try to see if you can add habit by clicking the timeline, but you cannot. To add a new habit, you have to click on the horizontal scrolling panel. This will open a popup and let you add a new habit. Once it's done, the third problem arise. How do you edit these habits? That time, you click the icon in the timeline. Why adding and editing is different and why do you need to go bottom-up to create habit is something that is very non-natural. Also, why using popup. Exercise used a slideout on the right side of the website which let you still see completely your workout while giving you the possibility to edit. The same design should have been kept. Not only for consistency on the website but also because it makes sense not to leave the user in an unknown state. For example, having a slide out with a list of habit that you can drag into the time line make sense. b:T585, to give you the possibility to vote for which features you would like the team to work on. This is great and they are still improving like they just added the possibility to control your music with your Band. The user interface is confusing on the phone and on the website. I have the feeling that both teams needed to ship something to show the data as fast as possible, and the result is what we see. The interface is lacking of options, you need to go in a lot of different places to get your data for example if you want to see your heart beat you need to go in Calories or Steps screen. Also, you will see plenty of spinners when loading graphs when it's the first time you access the data. Nevertheless, the art on the website are great. Lot of graphics, some SVG animations which are cool and most of the configuration are accompanied with great cartoon illustrations. Even if the color are not yet harmonized across the website, we see some experimentation and improvement coming in and out. The website looks alive and give the impression that they are working in the right direction to have the best experience possible. They have thought to have different view on every page depending of if you are interested to see a daily view, weekly, monthly, etc. Soon, I will try to develop with the SDK and write again my impression. I am already really exiting to see what we can do with the Microsoft Band 2.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Microsoft Band 2 WebSite and Phone UX Problems"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2016-01-08"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I really like my Microsoft Band 2 but there is some UX (user experience) problem that engineers and project managers need to be careful about.
