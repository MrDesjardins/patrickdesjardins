9:T544,The problem with mixing data from the API and from the user is that the user may type, change a configuration, set a temporary information and the data from the API does not change. The lack of separation causes issues in term of performance. A user change should never make an already formed object to be recomputed and build again: they have not changed. The reason is that the tree of objects changes if one of its node is changing. Let's see the consequence with a small example. An organization contains a list of site which contains a list of appliances which contains many children and so on. If we set the property "activeAppliance" in one of the sub-reducer of an appliance, it will have a chain of effect. First of all, the object that holds the "activeAppliance" will get a new reference (because of immutability), then the sub-reducer will get a new reference and its parents. But, it does not stop there. All memoized data ofReSelect or Re-reselect are flushed. The reason is Re-select selector are logically linked to specific are of the Reducer trees and check if something has changed. If nothing has changed, it returns a pre-computed denormalized instance. However, if not present or if the memoized selector has changed (which is the case with this example in many ways) it will invalidate the cache an perform a denormalization.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Redux Structure Best Practices"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2018-10-30"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I have been coding in one of our web application at Netflix for more than 15 months, and I realized that my Redux's state got better in time.

A commonplace, to denormalize is inside the mapping between the reducer and React. Depending on the complexity this can be expensive to construct.

For some reason, the Partner Portal requires to pass the whole state down to each selector.

However, with a custom shallow equal function that Re-reselect can use. The way I coded this one is that it checks if the object is the root of the reducer, if it is it avoids the invalidation.

For example, if you have an Organization entity coming from a REST API and you enhance the entity with some other data (e.g. add the preferred timezone that can be selected by the user) then you will be in a trap when the user change this non-persisted state.
