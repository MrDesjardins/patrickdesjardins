9:T510,The experience and numbers vary a lot depending on how the user interacts with the system. However, it is not rare to see that above 92% of requests of information are delivered by the cache. By delivered I mean that is returned to the user regardless if it comes from the memory cache, persisted cache or HTTP request. The other way to see it is that when a user clicks on the interface that only 8% of the data is requested via HTTP (slow). However, if the user stays under the same amount of feature the number can climb easily to 98%. Not only the amount of consumed data is very high at a level fast for the user, it is also very efficient in term of data moved across the network. Again, the number varies greatly depending on how the user interacts with the Netflix Partner Portal. But, it's not rare to see that only 10% of bytes used by the application are actually coming from HTTP request, while 90% are already cached by the library -- this means that on a session where a user performed many actions that instead of having to download about 150megs could have downloaded less than 15 megs of data. Great gain in term of user experience and great gain in term of relaxing our backend. Also, one gain for our user who saves bandwidth.

Most website goal is to have the user enjoy the experience and to have the user fulfill his or her goal in a fast and pleasant way. For example, you may have a user interface that requires 3 clicks but each click takes 5 seconds. Or, you could have a user interface that requires 4 clicks with 2 seconds each.

These patterns are still very relevant. Avoiding rendering helps the whole experience. In short, you can batch your Redux actions to avoid having several notifications that trigger potential view update. You can optimize the mapping of your normalized objects into denormalized objects by using a function in Redux-Connect to cancel the mapping. You can also avoid denormalizing by \"selecting\" the data if the normalize data in your reducers have not changed.

First, we were doing a lot of calls. Second, we were performing the same call over and over again in a short period of time. I open-sourced a library that we are using intensively for all our need of data called ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/MrDesjardins/dataaccessgateway/","children":"Data Access Gateway library"}],". It fixes the second issue right away by never performing two calls that are identical at the same time. When a request is performed and a second one wants the same information, the latter will subscribe to the first request. It means that all subsequent requesters are getting the information from the former requester -- it receives it pretty fast. The problem with several calls could be in theory handled better by having less generic REST endpoints. However, I had low control over the APIs. The ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/MrDesjardins/dataaccessgateway/","children":"Data Access Gateway library"}]," offers memory cache and persisted cache with IndexDb for free. It means that calls are cached and depending on the strategy selected in the library you can get the data almost instantly. For example, the library offers a \"fetchFast\" function that always returns as fast as possible the data even if this one is expired. It will perform the HTTP call to get fresh data which will be ready for the next request. The default is 5 minutes, and our data does not change that fast. However, we have a scenario where it must be very fresh. It is possible to tailor the caching for these cases. Also, it is possible to cache for a longer time. For example, a chart that displays information on a year period could be cached for almost a full day.

Every little optimization along the journey accumulates. I have been working for 13 months on the system and keep adding once in a while a new piece of code that boost the performance.
