9:T4b0,There are some workarounds. One popular approach is to avoid testing these functions directly. The problem is that you have code that is not tested. An alternative is to test these private functions through public function. The problem is that you are using a function to proxy all the logic which make all test less "unit test" and fragile because these tests become dependant on another piece of code. If the logic of the private function remains the same, but the public function change, the code that is testing the private function will fail. It sways the simplicity into a nightmare. If the private function returns a boolean value, but the public function returns a void type, testing the return of the private function requires to understand the behavior of the public function that use it to extrapolate a behavior that corresponds to the return value. The proxy function, the public function, might be only a single one or many. When there is only a single function, the choice is limited and can push you in a corner without escape. When many functions, the selection of which one can also be problematic. In the end, the goal is to unit test, not to have many hurdles before even testing.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"__className_aaf875","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_container__Tovb9","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"layout_siteTitle__k5U8g","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"layout_navLinks__mf70r","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkItem__1L8fB","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPictureContainer__XC7nK","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"layout_blogTopPicture__RJHNN","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"layout_main__mXTwS","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"TypeScript: Testing Private Members"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostContainer__WYELx","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostDate__LUvx5","children":["Posted on: ","2018-07-31"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["I ",["$","a",null,{"href":"how-to-unit-test-private-method","children":"wrote about three years ago on how to test private member"}],".
