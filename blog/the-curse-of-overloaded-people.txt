9:T4ae,The first perspective is the software engineer who has so many tasks in parallel that the person becomes paralyzed in every task. While it seems that this person is busy, the actual work is reduced by a large factor. The issue of taking too many initiatives is the multiplication of bureaucracy, the lack of focus, no time for teamwork and overseeing details. For example, the engineer will need to be in a meeting specific to these tasks, give time estimates, and update on each project. But, also will need to understand different business logic and might get into different technical challenges. Each task comes with peer review, code review, documentation, and test. Supporting the features and other tasks accumulate to a point where the engineer does not have any time. At the end of the year, it looks at the surface that this person was always in all meetings and in so many situations that the person must be an overachiever. However, looking at someone who was doing less at the same time will often show that at the end of the year, that same amount of actual work was done. Not only that, there is a huge chance that the person who did not overload himself produced a better experience.a:T5cb,The overloaded product manager works on the visibility and forgets the content of each task. They are so involved in different visible projects that they are always in meetings. They barely add thought to any project. Maybe early on when the project has the spotlight and gets the green light to move forward. Then, the product manager becomes a project manager who falls into the trap of micromanaging and asks about the end date without trying to iterate with the engineers about what could be better as the engineer brings more information. An overloaded project manager is never sitting in the team room and does not have the time to actually play with the demo or try to get deeper to understand the initial need of the user. For the engineer, it is hard to get a grasp of the product manager to bounce ideas as the project manager is already trying to get the next project going. The problem is that schedule shifts, bugs appear, and priority changes. A project manager might have been implicated in 20 different initiatives but 5 was really tangible. With an overloaded project manager, features often derail or the expectations are not aligned. Even with the many recurrent meetings, the overloaded project manager is so overloaded that the information is not really taken into consideration. In the meeting, the overloaded project manager is already using Slack and Microsoft Team to answer messages about other projects -- listening but not understanding important details.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"The Curse of the Overloaded People"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2025-01-24"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"In this short essay, I'll explain why people who overload their time are not only inefficient but a detriment to a team.

The result generates non-generic code, barely tested functionality, and lacks all the quality that the team might have agreed upon but the engineering managers or other people who influence the end-of-year results won’t know – they are also too busy.

They have a hard time keeping track of engineering matters and delegate every engineering decision to the most senior people on the team. These senior engineers become half engineer, half manager. Questioning the over-delegation does not happen because of the popular belief that a good manager knows how to delegate.

Software engineers want to create a good product and code but struggle. The product manager would like to follow up on their project as if it were their baby but just cannot be invested.
