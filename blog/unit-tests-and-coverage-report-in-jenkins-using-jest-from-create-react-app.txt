For many months, I didn't have the unit tests running on the platform. The reason is that I am, yet, used to how Jenkins works and even after several months feel VSTS more intuitive. Regardless, recently I took the time and setup to have my TypeScript code using Create-React-App to run my unit tests in these two Jenkins tasks.
