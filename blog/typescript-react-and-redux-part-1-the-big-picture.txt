The transformation is where the logic resides. The return values of a reducer is always a copy, immutable of the actual state. It's getting the actual state (JSON object) as a parameter and return back a JSON object with the same schema of the state that came in. For example, if the website allows having a different kind of filtering for the result, every user's choice will be sent to a reducer that will change the state to set the value of the filter selected and the new state will be returned by the reducer which will be stored in the store.

It receives properties to display and action is also part of delegate action passed by a property. The first type, the container component, is handling Redux. In our example, it's App.tsx. It's a stateless React component that is exported by using Redux's \"connect\" function which has two parameters that take care of the mapping between Redux's store state and the container component, and the other way around between the dispatcher actions to the component properties. The method that maps the state to the props allows to pass down a portion of the store instead of the whole store. The method that maps the dispatch to properties.
