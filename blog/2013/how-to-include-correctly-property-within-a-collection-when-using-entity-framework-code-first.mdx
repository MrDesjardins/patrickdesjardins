I have several [example](http://patrickdesjardins.com/blog/asnotracking-to-force-your-data-context-to-get-everything-from-the-database) in this website that include with a string the property when it's a property inside a collection of my main entity. Here is one example:

\[csharp\] return DatabaseContext .SetOwnable<Workout>() .Include(x => x.Sessions) .Include("Sessions.WorkoutSessionExercises") .Include("Sessions.WorkoutSessionExercises.Exercise") .Single(c => c.Id == id); \[/csharp\] At least, this example use the property for the Sessions. But why I wrote with a string for the two others includes? Because Sessions is a collection which doesn't let me link to one of its property. Instead, it links me to a list of property of the collection. This is quite logic if we think about it. However, I remain with the problem of using string which will lead in the maintenance phase to some possible problem when refactoring. Renaming a property won't change the string. This is why it would be better to specify the property of the collection.

This can be done by using the Linq method "**Select**". \[csharp\] return DatabaseContext .SetOwnable<Workout>() .Include(x => x.Sessions) .Include(x => x.Sessions.Select(d=>d.WorkoutSessionExercises)) .Include(x => x.Sessions.Select(d=>d.WorkoutSessionExercises.Select(g=>g.Exercise))) .Single(c => c.Id == id); \[/csharp\]

As you can see, we load the collection Sessions, then we load the collection WorkoutSessionExercise which is inside every Session. Finally, we load every Exercise that is a property without being a collection.

This example show you that even with multiple collection deep you can still avoid using string to specify that to include and what not.
