You can define association 1 to many and defining the relationship with both code snippet below. One is defined with a string, the other one with a property.

HasRequired with association defined by string: 
```csharp
 this.HasRequired(a => a.Property1) .WithMany() .Map(a => a.MapKey("MyFK")); 
```

HasRequired with association defined by property: 
```csharp
 this.HasRequired(a => a.Property1) .WithMany() .HasForeignKey(a => a.MyFK); 
```

Both mappings will create exactly the same database schema with a non nullable foreign key.

The mapping with **MapKey** is used when you don't want to have the foreign key as a property in your model context class. This is called _Independent Association_.

The mapping with **HasForeignKey** when the foreign key is a property in the model. This type is called _Foreign Key Association_.

You can use the one you want. Personally, I prefer to use the HasForeignKey because it's strongly mapped and if the property name is refactored that I am sure that the property will follow.
