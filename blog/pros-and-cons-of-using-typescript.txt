9:T434,If you need to debate about TypeScript or JavaScript, you should tackle the problem by first attacking the idea of typed language versus dynamic. This is the biggest battle. Typed language helps on a bigger scale or in a situation where people jump from one project to another. It also helps if you have new people coming in a project to understand faster what needs to be what. It also brings a potential error to the developer by having the code editor raising an error while developing which means less error at run-time. There are countless arguments in favor of strongly typed code. While losing the possibility to dynamically add properties on the fly, you win on having a well-established contract that can be extended if required. Dynamic type brings more drawback in the long term where people can add a property that could change the whole workflow without knowing it while writing type. Strongly typed code auto-document your code by mentioning what is expecting. It also reduces your number of unit tests by not having to check type for each parameter for example.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Pros and Cons of Using TypeScript"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2017-08-09"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["It's been 3 years that I've been using TypeScript daily.

It takes some time. However, most JavaScript project use Babel to transpile from one version of EcmaScript to another. It means that that the cons is only one if you are using vanilla JavaScript without any transformation. There is some way to improve the transpilation time by just compiling specific folders or by just compiling specific files. Also, it's possible to divide a huge application into several pieces where one piece can rely on the definition file generated by the other area. This latest suggestion allows compiling a big chunk of code that doesn't change often and have the other piece of code to use the generated JavaScript with the definition file. Only the piece that the developers are working on can be compiled. It's a little bit messier to setup, but still a viable approach."}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"children":"Babel as more Feature than TypeScript"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"TypeScript will be behind Babel as far as feature completeness goes because features need to be built by Microsoft.

Babel is having 40% of ES2016, TypeScript 36%, not a huge difference since it’s only 2 features. TypeScript rule is to only have polyfill for stage 3 and above, Babel brings earlier stage.
