While I am well aware of the feature of notifying to the user that a new version is ready to be served, I never implemented a solution myself. Gmail and many websites do it to allow the user to refresh the website which brings the new JavaScript, CSS and other assets. It is a great way to encourage users to refresh the page once in a while. With Web application, it occurs that some users do not refresh so often. Myself, I rarely refresh my Gmail webpage until I see the notification.

This week, someone raised the point that it would be interesting to have this feature on the application I am working on at Netflix. I wish I had time to do it, but instead of procrastinating, I decided to give it a try. The idea was to implement a way as cheap as possible since I have a backlog that is gargantuan. 

If you recall, a few days ago, I discussed [how to burn the Git hash into your React application](burning-the-last-git-commit-into-your-telemetry-log). The article described how to inject in the environment variable the Git hash of the actual build. It is done at compilation time and the React has a way to read the information from JavaScript. In my case, the version is stored in an environment variable named `REACT.APP_VERSION`. It is accessible at runtime. That being said, the version remains on the client browser until the user fetches the new JavaScript file that has a new value which happens only on a new build. The idea is to leverage the fact that if the client keeps the version until a new version is available, on a refresh, then checking once in a while for a version change is a matter of comparing the Git hash on the client machine to the actual head of the repository.

The idea can be broke down in few steps:

1. On build, burn the Git Hash into the JavaScript
2. On build, generate a file with the Git Hash
3. Fetch once in a while from the server a file that has the latest Git
4. If the Git Hash from the JavaScript environment variable is different from the file on the server, show a message to the user to refresh

The first step has been [already discussed](burning-the-last-git-commit-into-your-telemetry-log), but in short, it consists to change the `npm run build` to take the head Git hash and to pass it down to React.

``` 
 "build": "REACT_APP_VERSION=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) react-scripts-ts build"
``` 

The second step require a change on the build system. At Netflix, we are using Jenkins. I added a Bash Script step that look like the following:

``` 
CommitHash=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) 
echo "HASH" 
echo $CommitHash 
echo $CommitHash > "public/version.json" 
echo "VERSION FILE BEGIN" cat public/version.json 
echo "VERSION FILE END" 
``` 

The step number is open to how you want to handle it. I personally want to avoid `setTimout`. I rather have a Redux Middleware that will check once in a while. The middleware holds the time of the last check and on every action, verify that the time has elapsed from the threshold that you set. I have mine to 5 minutes. Every 5 minutes, or more depending of when the user does an action, it fetches the static file. As you can see in the previous step, the Git Hash is stored in a file under the `public` folder which is accessible with a simple Ajax call. If the string is different from the JavaScript environment variable, an action is dispatched that shows a message to the user to refresh the page.

```typescript
 const diff = this.currentTimeSinceEpoch() - this.lastCheck; 
 if (diff > SECONDS_BETWEEN_VERSION_CHECK) { 
   this.lastCheck = this.currentTimeSinceEpoch(); 
   (async () => { 
     const currentVersion = process.env.REACT_APP_VERSION === undefined ? "dev" : process.env.REACT_APP_VERSION; 
     try { 
        const file = await AjaxLibraryThatYouUse<string>({ 
         request: { url: "/version.json" 
         } 
        }); 
        const newVersion = file.result; 
        if (newVersion !== currentVersion) { 
          next(SharedActions.actionInfoMessage("New version available!")); 
        } 
      } catch (error) { 
        // Track error here 
      } 
    })(); 
  } 
``` 

The solution took less than writing this article! It might not be a push notification, neither having a complete Rest API. It is not the most elegant because we fetch every 5 minutes, but at the end of the day, a new feature is born in 15 minutes of work. Now, I'm back to my backlog!
