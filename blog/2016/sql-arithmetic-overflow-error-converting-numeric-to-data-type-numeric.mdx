When you are using straight ADO.Net with SQL you may come when using an operation that produce an overflow. This is often hard to debug if you are inside an update statement which update several fields. You may think than using **cast** or **convert** to the type of the destination field solve the problem, but it is not actually valid.

Here is two examples that show that even if you **convert** or **cast** it won't be enough.


```sql
 declare @dob1 as decimal(16,4) set @dob1 = cast(554656545465486786844864613 as decimal(16,4)) select @dob1

declare @dob2 as decimal(16,4) set @dob2 = CONVERT(decimal(16,4),5455531234268.68423224224244864613 ) select @dob2 
```


In my case, the problem was that I was performing an update in a field by executing a multiplication. field = field \* 1/2. The problem was that field was already, in some case, at 0 and sometime above the maximum which is 12 (16-4) digits. Even if the following code work fine.


```sql
 declare @dob3 as int set @dob3 = cast(0\*1/2 as int) select @dob3 
```


This one was not:


```sql
 declare @fromValue as int declare @toValue as int

set @fromValue = 1 set @toValue = 2

SELECT cast(Quantity \* @fromValue/@toValue as int) as newQuantity FROM [Trading].[Stock] 
```


However, adding a **where** clause eliminates edge cases to be proceeded. The trick is to handle result of 0 and result above the limit.


```sql
 declare @fromValue as int declare @toValue as int

set @fromValue = 1 set @toValue = 2

SELECT cast(Quantity \* @fromValue/@toValue as int) as newQuantity FROM [Trading].[Stock] WHERE Quantity > 0 AND Quantity < 999999999999 
```
