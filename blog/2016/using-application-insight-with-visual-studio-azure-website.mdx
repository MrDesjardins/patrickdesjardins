That mean that while coding, you may see that some exception go raised in your production server. From here, you can click Application Insight in CodeLens and see the number of exception as well as 2 links. The first one is **Search**. Search allows you to search in time the exception and get more information. It's possible to filter and search by exception type, country, ip, operation name (Asp.Net actions), etc. For example, here is a NullReferenceException thrown when users where accessing the Asp.Net MVC controller "UserContest" from the action "Detail". We can see in the stack trace and see who called the faulty method.
