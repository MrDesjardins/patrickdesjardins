I previously wrote about [how to configure a custom domain with Azure website](http://patrickdesjardins.com/blog/azure-dns-zone-and-namecheap), Azure DNS zone and Namecheap. What if you need to have two different domains that needs to be link to a single website? This is possible. First of all, you may wondering why to do so? Many scenarios are possible. For example, you can have a .com and a .net and you do not want to redirect. You may have multiple domains per language too.

The steps explained in the previous article are exactly what you need to follow, but twice. You will need to go in your domain provider (like namecheap) and setup the nameserver to a new Dns Zone. Yes that right, you need a single DNS zone per domain. From there, you can go in your website and add an additional custom external domain.
