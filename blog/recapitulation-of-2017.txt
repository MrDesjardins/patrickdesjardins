9:T52c, In July, it is not an objective, but an accomplishment and a challenge. I accepted the offer of Netflix. Time to move from Washington (Redmond) to California (San Jose). Moving with a toddler is not as easy that moving alone but it went well. Public transportation is lacking, and I needed to get a second car, which I chose to have an electric car. I am renting a house where we plan to stay for several years. I am right now in charge of a brand new web portal written in React, Redux and TypeScript. Like many projects at Netflix, individual contributors are responsible and own a lot of responsibilities and this portal is on my own shoulders -- I like it. I am learning about Docker, see a new way to work which is very different from every place I worked before. I am still adapting to that new style of work but enjoy having a lot of responsibilities. Netflix definitely treats its employees as self-sufficient for everything. This month was also with the objective to switch to a Mac and Google ecosystem, leaving Microsoft and Windows behind. I could have decided to work on a Dell computer with Windows, but since the majority of the developers are using a MacBook Pro I decided to jump and learn. So far so good, few things are better, few things are worse, overall I do not think it's worth a feud on any sides.a:T466, August was the time I realized that my English was worse than I thought. At Microsoft, there is a lot of immigrants (like myself) and the level of English was more forgiven. At Netflix, I found myself in many situations where using the exact right word was a missing key. Nothing bad, nothing wrong and all on me. So I decided to start studying a popular test called "GRE". I first intended to actually do the test at some point, but the level if a little higher than expected. I never gave up and from August to November spent 2 hours every weekday learning new words and reading preparation materials. I study new words using an application called Quizlet which I can enter words and definition. The application quizzes you afterward. So far, I have around 440 new entries and I am mastering half of them. I can definitely recognize all of them so, I plan to keep going but I slowly diminished the number of time to about 15 minutes per day. I am taking some pause to do few quizzes and go back to work. On the long term, I believe I'll grow my vocabulary and be able to have a more decent conversation with accurate words.b:T57f, September was the time to get an improvement physically. It was a while since I did some sport. Before moving to the USA (three years and a half ago), I was doing weight exercises three to four times every week. I continued in the USA until I got my daughter. I always felt bad to go to the gym while I had worked the whole day. And, when she was asleep, I had so many things to do that I skipped more and more the gym. In September, I decided to do cardio. I didn't want to run because I always hated it. So, I started doing jump rope. I started in September doing 2 minutes, 3 times per week. I am now at 14 minutes 3 times per week. I am increasing about 10 to 20 seconds every time. Little by little my cardio is getting better. It's also not too much time consuming and I can do it outside the house or in the garage hence keep an eye on my daughter while she sleeps and runs to her if she requests my attention. This month I also added a new objective to add 2 words per day in the application to keep me going to learn new words. This is good to start, but keeping the pace would be hard. I found myself forgetting older words, so I decided to stop adding new words in December to really master the 440 that I had. I was still a very good objective because when I started to study for the GRE in August, I had about 100 words. So, the 4 following months allowed to be successful with that objective.c:T58a,I am finishing writing this recapitulation and I am quite proud of this year. Once again, the year finish and I have the self-thought of wondering how can the next year be even better. One key principle I learned since I moved in the USA is that people make their own luck. I could wish to have a next new year awesome and just wait or to do actions. I decided to take monthly actions in 2018 and couldn't be happier. That being said, will I continue to have a monthly accomplishments or objectives every month next year? I am still debating. I like the idea to have a deadline to force myself to find something out of my comfort zone but this needs to be executed smartly. I plan to stay at Netflix in 2018, I plan to stay in California and plan to have bigger projects like starting the master program at Georgia Tech. There is a balance between quantity and quality and I foresee 2018 being less in quantity, and deeper in quality. There are many 2018 changes that I desire to pursue. I plan to continue to improve my vocabulary every month but won't go any further with the GRE. I plan to keep doing physical exercise and continue to write blog posts as well. I also really enjoy reading books, or should I say listen to audiobooks and will keep that habit. The important at the end is to be satisfied with what has been done and I am quite happy so mission accomplished. It was awesome 2017, looking for you 2018!2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Recapitulation of 2017"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2017-12-19"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["Every year, since about 5 years, I've been wondering how the next year could be better than the one that just finished.
