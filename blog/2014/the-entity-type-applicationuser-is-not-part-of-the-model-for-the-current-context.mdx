If you are using Asp.net Identity (OWIN authentification framework) with a custom user schema you may stumble into an error that you model is not part of the context.

> The entity type ApplicationUser is not part of the model for the current context.

[![NotPartOfTheModelOfTheCurrentContext](http://patrickdesjardins.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/NotPartOfTheModelOfTheCurrentContext-400x286.png)](http://patrickdesjardins.com/blog/the-entity-type-applicationuser-is-not-part-of-the-model-for-the-current-context/notpartofthemodelofthecurrentcontext)

This exception is raised if you go to the login screen and try to log in. It occurs if you have a DbContext class that inherit directly to DbContext and not of IdentityDbContext.

Your database context must be aware of Identity tables.


```csharp
 public class DatabaseContext :IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser> 
```

Having this inheritance solve the problem.
