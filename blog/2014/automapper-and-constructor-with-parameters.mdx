In some use case you are forced to have classes that has **constructor with parameters**. This is more rare if you are using Entity Framework (EF) because it requires to have parameterless constructor. However, if the scenario occurs, remember that **AutoMapper** does not have this constrain. In fact, you can have a private parameterless constructor for Entity Framework (EF) and force the use of a public constructor with parameters when using in your code.

First of all, during the mapping configuration, you must use **ConstructUsingServiceLocator** method. \[csharp highlight="2"\] Mapper.CreateMap<ContestEditableViewModel, Model.Entities.Contest.Contest>() .ConstructUsingServiceLocator(); \[/csharp\]

This instruct AutoMapper to check for the option **ConstructServicesUsing** method that can be provided during the mapping instruction.

Second, when you are using AutoMapper to map between classes, you must specify every parameters.

\[csharp\] var model = AutoMapper.Mapper.Map<ContestEditableViewModel, Model.Entities.Contest.Contest>(viewModel , options=>options.ConstructServicesUsing( t=>new Model.Entities.Contest.Contest(yourFirstParameter, yourSecondParameter, /\*and so on\*/) ) ); \[/csharp\]

This way, you can have classes that have parameters and control how to provided them values.
