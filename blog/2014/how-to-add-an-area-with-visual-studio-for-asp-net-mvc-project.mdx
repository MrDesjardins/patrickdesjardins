Adding an area can be done manually by adding a folder inside your Web Site project under the **Areas** folder. From there you can add a folder for your controller. However, a better way exist that create for your the area with all folders required. It also add the \_ViewStart.cshtml for you. If you right click the Areas folder you will not find anything related to **Add Area**.
