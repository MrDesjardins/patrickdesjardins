If you started doing some code modification but you realize that you should have done these modifications in a branch instead of directly into the branch you did the modification, you can move all files into a new branch. The command is checkout with the parameter **\-b** which create the branch if this one does not exist.

\[code\] git checkout -b NewBranch git add . \[/code\]

The git **add .** simply add all uncommited file into the staged area.

Other possibility exist like using **git stash** to move uncommited code into a temporary place and unstash into another branch. \[code\] git stash git checkout NewBranch git stash apply \[/code\]
