9:T4e0,We need a HTML file to host the JavaScript files produced by TypeScript. We could directly load the JavaScript produced by a script tag in the HTML, but that won't be good in the long run. The problem doing so is that the first script will refer the second script by module which will need require with EcmaScript 5 and below. While the specifications are out for EcmaScript 6, and that we can use the syntax with TypeScript, the output resulted must be downgraded in EcmaScript 5 which require an AMD loader, like require.js. TypeScript alone can generate JavaScript files at the right place, but JavaScript files from npm package will be located at the wrong place : in node_modules. Ideally, we want to take the needed one into a specific path, for example under "vendors" folder. First step, let's configure TypeScript to generate the JavaScript file into "output" folder. To do so we need to have a tsconfig.json that specify few options. Options are read by Typescript when tsc command line is executed in the folder that has the json file. Before going any further, make sure you have installed TypeScript and have in your path the bin folder. At this time, I have downloaded TypeScript in the official website and have in my machine path : 2:["$","div",null,{"className":"__className_aaf875","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_container__Tovb9","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"layout_siteTitle__k5U8g","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"layout_navLinks__mf70r","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkItem__1L8fB","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"layout_navLinkText__bt28R","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPictureContainer__XC7nK","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"layout_blogTopPicture__RJHNN","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"layout_main__mXTwS","children":[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Visual Studio Code with NPM and TypeScript (Part 2 : TypeScript)"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostContainer__WYELx","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"layout_blogPostDate__LUvx5","children":["Posted on: ","2017-02-20"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"In the previous article, we got introduced to NodeJs and npm.
