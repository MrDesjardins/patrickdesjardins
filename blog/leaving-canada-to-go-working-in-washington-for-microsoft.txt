9:T7fc,Microsoft offered us a temporary apartment for 45 days. They suggest us to start finding an apartment as soon as we get there cause it can takes time before finding something you want. For us, we started way before coming to Washington. We had a list of 30 apartments in a spreadsheet with different criteria. For us, the location was a big concern since we do not wanted to have a car there. Even with all the researches and countless hours of simulation, we got an apartment that wasn't in our list. The problem between Internet and being on place is that with Internet you cannot see how the lighting is really, what is the real condition of the apartment, what is really available, etc. Prices are also not what is provided on Internet. The personal assistant was also able to tell us some feedback from previous renters. Before leaving we were expecting to pay around 1500$US for a 2 bedrooms. We wanted to have a 2 bedrooms because we are planning to have our first child in the first year. Well, we finished to pay 1810$. The reason is that apartment in the range of 1500$ for 2 bedrooms are not located in place that you can easily do your grocery by walk. We are living right in the downtown of Redmond, within 8 minutes from a grocery. We could also go to two others, cheaper, groceries at 20 and 25 minutes of walk -- we never go to those grocery, it is too far. We are also located near of the transit center. It takes me 1 minute walk to get plenty of bus. Three buses can get me to Microsoft in less than 18 minutes. Having an apartment in the range of Microsoft by bus under 30 minutes and having a grocery under 10 minutes walk has a price. The following picture illustrate the apartment location and some facilities. The marker #1 is the apartment, the market #2 is the grocery that we go every week. The third one is the transit center. The Redmond Town Center is flagged with a 4, this is a mall center. Finally, the fifth marker show you the second closest grocery that is too far for us to go by walk, possible but too far.a:T654,Microsoft rental car is very convenient at first to get all the missing stuff you need. Even if you come with your stuff from your country, you will need foods and essential products to clean, etc. My wife got the car scratched in a parking whilst she was doing some errands and Microsoft insurance paid everything. Once moved, I kept the car for my wife and took the bus. Microsoft pay for all its employee a monthly bus card. This is awesome and save you about 100$ per month. Buses are very great in the King County (Redmond, Bellevue, Seattle area). Microsoft is located near of the Overlake Transit Center. My building is the 18, so I can walk from the Overlake Transit Center to the building in less than 2 minutes. Since we are living next to a transit center, to go to another transit center is pretty easy. I have the 545, 542 and B-Line that goes in either direction every 10 to 30 minutes. I rarely have to wait because I can just take any of them. Going to downtown Seattle take 35 minutes during the weekend. Perfect to go shopping or simply take a walk there. I prefer doing 35 minutes once in a while than every day, in the traffic living in Seattle takes more than 50 minutes of bus and this is if you live at the center of Seattle which is very expensive. So after 7 months, I can tell you that it is possible to live without a car in the area. Not always easy, but possible. Even going to the Tacoma Airport is not a big deal. You need to take the train (which is cover with the bus pass) and than take 1 bus (545). It takes about 1 hour 20 minutes. It is long but we do that travel only once per year.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Leaving Canada to go Working in Washington for Microsoft"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2015-04-09"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":["Since August 1st, 2014 my wife and I have moved to Redmond in the state of Washington (USA).

It was also a big change since we were getting married later in the year -- we had to change our plan and to re-plan the wedding 4 months in advance.

From Tacoma, we went to Bellevue to get the key of our temporary apartment which were in Kirkland. I am working at Redmond the next Monday (we moved Friday). Nothing is perfect, but the car helped us a lot. 30 days is a little low because you have to find a new apartment, and figure out where everything is and in the same time you start working.
