9:T446, function that can leverage the immutability model. Breaking down is crucial. Small components allow only to update a piece where the information changes. Immutability reduces complex checks and avoids having an issue in the long term if fields are added to the model (which would also require being added in the check of the component that consumed it). I have the habit of running the performance tools of Chrome quite often every day, and I noticed that a bad habit is to break down the render in private functions. The problem is that these functions are always executed even if the part they render is not changing. Breaking down into smaller components avoid this pitfall of wasteful rendering. In my case, not a lot of gain was realized because everything was correctly implemented. However, I noticed that the main menu was rendering an expensive user’s profile on every render. The cause: a private function that was rendering something that should only be rendered once, and only after when the user activates a menu! I got a gain of 120ms just by having a unique component, a good 2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],[["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.jpeg","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"4 Features to Boost React-Redux Performance"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2018-05-01"]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"Recently, I've been optimizing one of our websites and I've seen tremendous improvement by adding or modifying some behaviors of how Redux and React communicate.
