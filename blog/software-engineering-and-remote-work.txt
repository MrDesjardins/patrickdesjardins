9:T435,I've been on-site my whole life, when I lived in Canada, and the same when I started my career at Microsoft in the USA. From that point on, the collaboration couldn't have gone better, and the idea of being remote or hybrid never even crossed my mind. Moving to the US, I had a great campus at Microsoft, and I enjoyed walking and talking to the PM/EM or my teammates. I bonded well with the team while keeping a standard 8 hours. In the US, my commute was always under 30 minutes. I had a mixed experience with public transportation and my car. I also had experience both with and without kids. At this point, I had no issue going to the office, and it was normal. I started having a great experience with my PM and with some of my teammates. We were having casual conversations, discussing what we liked or didn't, and even talking about potential ideas we could try to implement. I also learned more about each person's personality, which helped navigate some tricky conversations, and, overall, the non-verbal cues in many interactions made for a good in-person experience.a:T422,Here is where it started to slip, even in a team that knew each other. Only a quarter of people came back to the office. Lunch, side conversation, and cross-team were not the same. Not at all. People started to be more divided. Information was not flowing as well. The moral was different from my perspective. Walking to a team room wasn't the same, as you never knew if the right person was there. Same for our team: our leaders weren't always there, and some more tenured people stayed completely remote while not adjusting their communication. It was clear to me that if the same company and team that were so efficient and great were now operating in a different mode, then something was different. My hypothesis was (and remains) that fully on-site was the best for communication, team-sharing, team-bonding, and so many other qualities of teamwork. That is true for the immediate team you work with, but also for the cross-team. Fully remote wasn't that bad either, but required more effort, and is still fine, though not optimal. Hybrid was the worst.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_BlogBody__600mT","children":[["$","header",null,{"className":"BlogBody_siteTitle__f7uyb","children":"Patrick Desjardins Blog"}],["$","nav",null,{"children":["$","ul",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinks__ZV12t","children":["$","li",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkItem__Pml2e","children":[["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/","children":"Main Page"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog","children":"Blog"}],["$","$L6",null,{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/search","children":"Search"}],[["$","$L6","2026",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2026","children":2026}],["$","$L6","2025",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2025","children":2025}],["$","$L6","2024",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2024","children":2024}],["$","$L6","2023",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2023","children":2023}],["$","$L6","2022",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2022","children":2022}],["$","$L6","2021",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2021","children":2021}],["$","$L6","2020",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2020","children":2020}],["$","$L6","2019",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2019","children":2019}],["$","$L6","2018",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2018","children":2018}],["$","$L6","2017",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2017","children":2017}],["$","$L6","2016",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2016","children":2016}],["$","$L6","2015",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2015","children":2015}],["$","$L6","2014",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2014","children":2014}],["$","$L6","2013",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2013","children":2013}],["$","$L6","2012",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2012","children":2012}],["$","$L6","2011",{"className":"BlogBody_navLinkText__ZtH2y","href":"/blog/for/2011","children":2011}]]]}]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogPictureContainer__IAbPL","children":["$","$L8",null,{"className":"BlogBody_blogTopPicture__L6lao","alt":"Patrick Desjardins picture from a conference","src":"/images/backgrounds/patrickdesjardins_conference_bw.webp","width":800,"height":260}]}],["$","main",null,{"className":"BlogBody_main__XrdKY","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"BlogBody_heading__bYRBe","children":"Software Engineering and Remote Work"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostContainer__AUIcf","children":[["$","p",null,{"className":"Page_blogPostDate__wVWWB","children":["Posted on: ","2025-10-29"]}],[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Preface"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"I will skim some of the context, but in recent years, I have been in many different companies and teams with different operational models, including remote, hybrid, and in-office.

When I started, someone new started in Seattle and ramped up a lot faster than I did. Also, being at the office meant always meeting with people over a remote call (like Zoom).

I witnessed a significant disconnect between many platform teams, who were unaware of how their engineers used the system, and many high-level leaders, who were unaware of inefficiencies in the process.
