The user will not see the trick we just put in place. In reality, we had a life cycle in React that position the element at its final place but we used CSS to return the element back into its original place -- the place the component was before the render. And then we let the browser render the element that has a style that put immediately the component into its initial place with an animation to let go the component into its final position.`}</p>\n    <p>{`From a JQuery perspective, it's a lot of more work with React. However, that is the cost to pay to have an optimized framework that takes care of the DOM/HTML for you. In that particular case, where the HTML must be accessed, there is a little tax to set up everything correctly. However, since most of the React's components are not animated and that the core goal is to let React handle the painting it is a small pain for an overall nice performance gain.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
