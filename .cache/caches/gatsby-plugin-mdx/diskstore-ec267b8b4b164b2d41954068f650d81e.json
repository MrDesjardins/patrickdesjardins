It allows to have a good separation of concerns and have these presentation containers not aware of Redux's action creator and reducer.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Now, at the heart of the goal of this article, how do we bind the state to the props used as parameter of this stateless container? We know the we should return inject an IAppProps and we know we have the store having a IAppState. What needs to be done is a mapping function that will transform one to the other.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`const mapStateToProps = (state: IAppState) => { return { model: state, } as IAppProps }; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The second goal is how do we map the actions received by callback methods to the action creator. Very similar to the prop-state. We need a mapping function. The dispatch interface we defined as IAppDispatch is used to bind these actions to a concrete method in the actions creator. `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch: Dispatch<IAppState>): IAppDispatch => { \n  return { \n    onApply: () => { \n      dispatch(updateFilter()); \n    }, \n    filterChange: (filters: IFilters) => { \n      dispatch(filterChanged(filters)); \n      } \n    } as IAppDispatch; }; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`We finally needs to not return the simple stateless function, but to return the result of the Redux function connect. `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App); \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`At that point, if the store is updated, the information will flow to the container component. If something happen, the action will be dispatched to the action creators and the reducer. In this article, we closed the loop by creating a simple React and Redux application that allow to have a simple action dispatched through an action creator to a reducer to modify the store to update our component. In the next article, we will see how to execute more than a single action from a single call to an action creator. This will be useful for scenario like requesting data where we expect the action creator to dispatch a loading state to have the user interface showing a loading animation and to invoke another dispatch when the data is received which stop the loading animation and load the information on the screen.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Articles of the series:`}</h3>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-1-the-big-picture\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript, React and Redux`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-2-creating-the-store-and-the-reducer\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript and Redux Store`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-3-binding-the-store-and-component\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript Redux Store Binding`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-4-multiple-returns-from-action-creator\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript Redux Action Creators`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-5-reducer-with-different-actions\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript, React and Redux Part 5 : Reducer with Different Actions`}</a></li>\n    </ol>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
