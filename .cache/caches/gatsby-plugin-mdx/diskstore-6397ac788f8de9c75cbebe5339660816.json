So, first, before doing anything there is two important steps to do. We need to ensure that we have a descriptor defined (third parameter). This may be overridden by another decorator, hence we need to be sure it's defined, if not to create back this one. Then, we need to do a copy of the original method because we want to execute it at the proper time.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`export function performanceLog(outputConsole: boolean, thresholdToDisplayErrorInMs: number = 1000) { return (target: any, propertyKey: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) => { // Ensure we have the descriptor that might been overriden by another decorator if (descriptor === undefined) { descriptor = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(target, propertyKey); } // Copy const originalMethod = descriptor.value; // To be continued }; } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Next, we need to create the new function that will be swapped from the original. This is done by defining a new function in the descriptor.value. You should not use the arrow function syntax because it will mess up the \"this\" pointer. To get more data for the log, you can get all parameters passed by stringify all parameters. After, you can start a timer and get the user time and call the original method. You must collect the result (in case of method that return something else than void) and stop the timer.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`// Redefine the method to this new method who will call the original method // Use the function's this context instead of the value of this when log is called (no arrow function) descriptor.value = function (...args: any[]) { const parametersAsString = args.map((parameter) => JSON.stringify(parameter)).join(\",\"); const startTime = window.performance.now(); const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args); // Call the original method const endTime = window.performance.now(); const timespan = endTime - startTime; const stringResult = JSON.stringify(result); // To be continued } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The last step is to bring everything to live with showing in the console the performance by using the threshold.

Decorator with method are a lot more straight forward than other decorator that require other library to extract meta-data for example. Decorators are getting more popular and start to be even cornerstone to some popular JavaScript framework like Angular 2 (and 4). Like every new shiny language feature, using at the proper time is the key of success.\n\n\nexport const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"TypeScript Class Decorator : Method Performance\",\"date\":\"2017-05-09\",\"categories\":[\"typescript\"]}\n`}</code></pre>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
