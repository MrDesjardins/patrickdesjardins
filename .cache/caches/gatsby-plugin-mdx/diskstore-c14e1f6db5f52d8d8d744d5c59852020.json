The store is where the data is stored and where the reducer will be invoked. To have the store being able to use a reducer, we need to pass down the reducer in the create store function. To have the store being able to notify our React's components, we need to use a \"react-redux\" component. This component goal is to notify the React component to update. This helper is named \"Provider\" and come from \"react-redux\" and pass a store property which is the created store few lines above. The missing piece is the reducer to pass to the store. This is coming from your own file. In this example, it's coming from a file that we will see in the next paragraph named \"appReducer\".`}</p>\n    <p>{`The example allows the user to change some filter options to get picture depending on the selected criteria. The reducer will modify the state (store) depending on what the user selects from the form. The reducer will be called by the React component (see later in this article) with an action which the reducer will digest. That is why we import the action at the beginning of this file. The second important type of class to import is the contract/schema of the store. The reducer is the only one who modifies the state of the store, hence needs to know about the interface of the state. Finally, we need to import the action creator (we will see soon) which will indicate to the reducer which action that is active right now.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Below the imports, the file contains an initial state which is how the state should be if nothing has been yet initialized.

The reducer is a single method that takes the state and the action. The state and the action come from the component. If you need to send a subset of the state there are multiple possibilities. You can use multiple states in the store and use a combined reduced (will be discussed in a future article) or copy the actual state (so immutable) and alter the modified value. The latter is what we will do.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`export function appReducer(state: IAppState = initialState, action: IUpdateFilterActionCreator): IAppState { \n  switch (action.type) { \n    case RESET: \n      return initialState; \n    case FILTER_CHANGED: \n      return Object.assign({}, state, { filters: action.filters }) as IAppState; \n    case SHOW_RESULT: \n      return Object.assign({}, state, { results: action.results }) as IAppState; \n    default: return state \n    } \n} \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The reducer looks for the action and alters the state by returning a new state. This is important to always return a new object with a brand new reference. This makes the store's state immutable. If someone tries to change the value of the store somewhere else, it won't affect the React components. In this example, we have 3 actions which one reset the filters to the initial state, one that changes the filter from the filters object received by the \"Apply\" button from the UI and one that will be executed once the filter got applied (after the request to the back-end returned a response.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this article, we created a store with the createStore method provided by Redux.
