The change start with NPM module that we need to use. As we saw, we can remove RequireJS from the dependencies list. We also need to bring many libraries for Webpack, loader and utility library to clean and move files. Here is the complete list of dependencies:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`\"devDependencies\": { \n  \"@types/express\": \"^4.0.35\", \n  \"@types/jquery\": \"^2.0.46\", \n  \"@types/react\": \"^15.0.26\", \n  \"@types/react-dom\": \"^15.5.0\", \n  \"@types/systemjs\": \"^0.20.2\", \n  \"awesome-typescript-loader\": \"^3.1.3\", \n  \"copyfiles\": \"^1.2.0\", \n  \"del-cli\": \"^1.0.0\", \n  \"express\": \"^4.15.3\", \n  \"file-loader\": \"^0.11.2\", \n  \"html-webpack-plugin\": \"^2.28.0\", \n  \"source-map-loader\": \"^0.2.1\", \n  \"typescript\": \"^2.3.4\", \n  \"webpack\": \"^2.6.1\", \n  \"tslint\": \"^5.4.2\" \n}, \n\"dependencies\": { \n  \"jquery\": \"^3.2.1\", \n  \"react\": \"^15.5.4\", \n  \"react-dom\": \"^15.5.4\" \n} \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The next step is that we won't use Gulp to invoke action. If we want to delete previous generated deploy files, build TypeScript or run the server, we need to use the CLI of each of the tool we are using. We could use directly the TypeScript's CLI, named tcs, and use xcopy to move file, etc. The problem is that it is not easy to remember. NPM allows to have custom script which can be invoked with `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`npm use ABC`}</inlineCode>{` where \"ABC\" is the name of your script. Here is the script we need to add to replace the Gulp tasks we had.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`\"scripts\": { \n  \"clean\": \"del-cli deploy/**\", \n  \"package\": \"./node_modules/.bin/webpack --config webpack.config.js --display-error-details\", \n  \"copy\": \"copyfiles -u 1 ./app/index.html ./deploy\", \n  \"build\": \"del-cli deploy/**  SET NODE_ENV=development  webpack --config webpack.config.js --display-error-details  copyfiles -u 1 ./app/index.html ./deploy/\", \n  \"server\": \"node bin/www.js\", \n}, \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The \"clean\" script use the \"del-cli\" to delete the deployment folder. This could be use a native Windows or Linux command, but using this tool allows to be cross platform. The \"package\" allows to run webpack with a specific configuration file and for debugging purpose to display verbose detail. The principle is the same for all others script. The \"build\" one is using the clean + package + copy. So, in practice, you should use only build and server.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The final step is to configure Webpack. This is done in the file webpack.config.js. You can rename it the way you want, you just need to specify it in the webpack command after --config. Webpack can use many NPM package to accomplish its job. For sure, you need at least the \"webpack\" package.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`var path = require('path'); var webpack = require('webpack'); \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Webpack needs to have an entry point. In the example we are working on, the main file is the one that was used in the index.html with `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`requirejs(['file1']);`}</inlineCode>{`. This time, we do not have any indication in the HTML file. However, Webpack needs one, or many, entry point and will navigate through all the dependencies to make the main bundle.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`module.exports = { entry: { app: \"./app/scripts/file1.tsx\" }, \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Entry`}</strong>{` may be the entry point, `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Output`}</strong>{` will be where the bundles goes. The filename uses the square bracket which will be replaced by the key provided by each entry point. In our example, we have \"app\" in the entry, and we will have a file produced with the name \"appbundle.js\" in the output. The directory is provided at the \"path\" property, which in that case is \"deploy\".`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`output: { path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'deploy'), filename: '[name]bundle.js' }, \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The next configuration is to tell which extension Webpack should care of. For us, it's TypeScript `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`resolve: { extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx'] }, \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{` This property allows to have source map. This give the possibility to debug TypeScript in Chrome on the real individual file even if it's bundled. `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`devtool: \"source-map\", \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Webpack work with rules. Every \"test\" evaluate a condition to execute a loader. We use two different ones. One to call the TypeScript loader that will transpile TS and TSX file. The second one is to generate source map. Even if we have the devtool to provide source map, we need a central place to handle third-party JS library too. `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`module: { \n  rules: [ \n    { test: /\\\\\\\\.tsx?$/, loader: \"awesome-typescript-loader\" },\n    { enforce: \"pre\", test: /\\\\\\\\.js$/, loader: \"source-map-loader\" }, \n  ] \n}, \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The last piece is a plugin called CommonsChunkPlugin. It comes from Webpack and its role is to great additional bundle. In that case, we create a bundle name \"vendorbundle.js\". The minChunk can be a number of time we see the reference to join the bundle. For example, if we have a module that we use often and that we want them to be in a common bundle, we can say \"5\" and if more than 5 modules reference than instead of being in the \"app\" one, it would go in this one. For us, we want to have all vendors module, which mean they are from node_modules directory. To do so, the minChunks allows to pass a function. When it contains the node_modules in the path, it goes into that bundle instead of the main one (app). `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`plugins: [ \n  new webpack.optimize.CommonsChunkPlugin(\n    { name: \"vendor\", \n    filename: \"vendorbundle.js\", \n    minChunks: function(module) { \n      return module.context  module.context.indexOf('node_modules') !== -1; } \n    }) \n  ] }; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`You can find the exact code from `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/MrDesjardins/TypeScriptReactBoilerplate/tree/8d4f43791e9a21cd89fbcce88e7267b72a9210f7\"\n      }}>{`this commit in GitHub`}</a>{`. In this article, we saw how to remove Gulp to use Webpack. Not only it removes dependencies to Gulp and Gulp's packages, it also bring a powerful tool to bundle smartly. The next step will be to bring an auto-reload when the code change to have TypeScript compile automatically to get JS deployed.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
