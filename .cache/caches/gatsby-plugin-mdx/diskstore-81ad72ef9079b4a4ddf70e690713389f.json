For example, let's make the forth task use the third one result. That mean that the third task must be completed before the forth one to allow the forth task to use the result of the third one. \\n```csharp\\n var allStrings = new List<Task<string>>(); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Start\\\"); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add First\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"First\\\", 1000)); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add Second\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"Second\\\", 500)); //Thread.Sleep(5000); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add Third\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"Third\\\", 3000)); string thirdTask = \\\"Default Third String\\\"; thirdTask = await allStrings.Last(); //We are awaiting the third task here to use the string into the forth's task Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add Forth\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"Forth\\\" + thirdTask, 200));\\n\\nConsole.WriteLine(\\\"Wait All\\\"); var task = allStrings.ToList(); var allAwaitedTask = await Task.WhenAll(task); foreach (var s in allAwaitedTask) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"->\\\" + s); } Console.WriteLine(\\\"Finish\\\"); \\n``` To make the forth task use the result of the third task, we need to **await** the third task before the call of the forth's one.![](images/AsyncExample3-400x206.png)\\n\\nIf you want to try this into a console by copy-pasting the code in this article, you will get into some problem. The reason is as stated at the beginning, console does not support async code. We need to create from the console a async task that will handle all the async code. This can be done by using **Task.Run(async()=>{/*You code here*/});** That mean that we would do: \\n```csharp\\n static void Main(string[] args) {\\n\\nTask.Run(async() => { var allStrings = new List<Task<string>>(); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Start\\\"); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add First\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"First\\\", 1000)); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add Second\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"Second\\\", 500)); //Thread.Sleep(5000); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add Third\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"Third\\\", 3000)); string thirdTask = \\\"Default Third String\\\"; thirdTask = await allStrings.Last(); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Add Forth\\\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\\\"Forth\\\" + thirdTask, 200));\\n\\nConsole.WriteLine(\\\"Wait All\\\"); var task = allStrings.ToList(); var allAwaitedTask = await Task.WhenAll(task); foreach (var s in allAwaitedTask) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"->\\\" + s); } Console.WriteLine(\\\"Finish\\\");\\n\\n}).Wait(); Console.WriteLine(\\\"Press Any Keys to stop\\\"); Console.ReadLine(); }\\n\\nprivate static async Task<string> GiveMeAStringAsync(string suffixe, int millisecondTaskTake) { Console.WriteLine(\\\"Begin GiveMeAString:\\\" + suffixe +\\\" for \\\" + millisecondTaskTake);\\n\\nawait Task.Delay(millisecondTaskTake);\\n\\nConsole.WriteLine(\\\"End GiveMeAString:\\\" + suffixe + \\\" for \\\" + millisecondTaskTake); return \\\"GiveMeString execute \\\" + suffixe; } \\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Async\"), \" works with \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"await\"), \". Every time a code calls an asynchronous method, the code is executed until it reaches a task that is \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"await\"), \". When the code is awaited, the thread is released and the flow continues on the caller code until it reaches another await call. In the example, every time we were calling the \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"GiveMeAStringAsync\"), \" method, the console was writting that it begins and then wait. From this wait, the code was going back to the caller -- the Main method -- and continue its way until it reaches and other await. This is why we were able to see all \\\"Begin GiveMeAString\\\" message at the beginning because the code was never stopping until it reaches the \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"Task.WhenAll\"), \" which was also in an await but this time was the last because it was running into a Task.Run with a Wait.

We do it because we want to display the result of each of these methods. `}<span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"400px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/4b1313c3e3c1abd7a713c6ad390b14e2/e17e5/AsyncExample1-400x228.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"57.00000000000001%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"AsyncExample1 400x228\",\n            \"title\": \"AsyncExample1 400x228\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/4b1313c3e3c1abd7a713c6ad390b14e2/e17e5/AsyncExample1-400x228.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/4b1313c3e3c1abd7a713c6ad390b14e2/5a46d/AsyncExample1-400x228.png 300w\", \"/static/4b1313c3e3c1abd7a713c6ad390b14e2/e17e5/AsyncExample1-400x228.png 400w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{` var allStrings = new List<Task<string>>(); Console.WriteLine(\"Start\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Add First\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"First\", 1000)); Console.WriteLine(\"Add Second\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"Second\", 500)); Thread.Sleep(5000); Console.WriteLine(\"Add Third\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"Third\", 3000)); string thirdTask = \"Default Third String\"; //thirdTask = await allStrings.Last(); Console.WriteLine(\"Add Forth\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"Forth\" + thirdTask, 200));\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Wait All\"); var task = allStrings.ToList(); var allAwaitedTask = await Task.WhenAll(task); foreach (var s in allAwaitedTask) { Console.WriteLine(\"->\" + s); } Console.WriteLine(\"Finish\"); \n\\`\\`\\` ![](images/AsyncExample2-400x228.png)\n\nAnother example would be that a task depends on a previous task. For example, let's make the forth task use the third one result.

The reason is as stated at the beginning, console does not support async code. We need to create from the console a async task that will handle all the async code. This can be done by using **Task.Run(async()=>{/*You code here*/});** That mean that we would do: \n\\`\\`\\`csharp\n static void Main(string[] args) {\n\nTask.Run(async() => { var allStrings = new List<Task<string>>(); Console.WriteLine(\"Start\"); Console.WriteLine(\"Add First\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"First\", 1000)); Console.WriteLine(\"Add Second\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"Second\", 500)); //Thread.Sleep(5000); Console.WriteLine(\"Add Third\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"Third\", 3000)); string thirdTask = \"Default Third String\"; thirdTask = await allStrings.Last(); Console.WriteLine(\"Add Forth\"); allStrings.Add(GiveMeAStringAsync(\"Forth\" + thirdTask, 200));\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Wait All\"); var task = allStrings.ToList(); var allAwaitedTask = await Task.WhenAll(task); foreach (var s in allAwaitedTask) { Console.WriteLine(\"->\" + s); } Console.WriteLine(\"Finish\");\n\n}).Wait(); Console.WriteLine(\"Press Any Keys to stop\"); Console.ReadLine(); }\n\nprivate static async Task<string> GiveMeAStringAsync(string suffixe, int millisecondTaskTake) { Console.WriteLine(\"Begin GiveMeAString:\" + suffixe +\" for \" + millisecondTaskTake);\n\nawait Task.Delay(millisecondTaskTake);\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"End GiveMeAString:\" + suffixe + \" for \" + millisecondTaskTake); return \"GiveMeString execute \" + suffixe; } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Async`}</strong>{` works with `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`await`}</strong>{`. Every time a code calls an asynchronous method, the code is executed until it reaches a task that is `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`await`}</strong>{`. When the code is awaited, the thread is released and the flow continues on the caller code until it reaches another await call. In the example, every time we were calling the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`GiveMeAStringAsync`}</em>{` method, the console was writting that it begins and then wait. From this wait, the code was going back to the caller -- the Main method -- and continue its way until it reaches and other await. This is why we were able to see all \"Begin GiveMeAString\" message at the beginning because the code was never stopping until it reaches the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Task.WhenAll`}</strong>{` which was also in an await but this time was the last because it was running into a Task.Run with a Wait. Programming with asynchronous requires a new mind set. It is not easy, and I am not used to work this way too. Since the first 10 years with .Net we had to work in a more sequential ways or to use thread to create parallelism. Now, the syntax is clean, the superfluous of handling threads is abstracted with the await and async keyword. Working with async improves the resource of your system and is something that must be considered more and more in the future of high depend website and service to lower your cost and increase the performance of your system.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can find this code on GitHub : `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/MrDesjardins/AsyncTaskExperience\"\n      }}>{`https://github.com/MrDesjardins/AsyncTaskExperience`}</a></p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
