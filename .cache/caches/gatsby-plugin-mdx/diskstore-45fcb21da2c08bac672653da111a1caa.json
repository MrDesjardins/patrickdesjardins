Also, this article will focus on Entity Framework 5.0 but the concept behind is the same : the repository must be abstracted from the controller. The main reason is that we want to be able to respect the single responsibility principle. The controller responsibility is not about how to load or save entity but to know how to dispatch. This why we will follow separation of concern idea by having classes that will handle the repository. By separating the repository we will use many classes to have a set of cohesive class.
