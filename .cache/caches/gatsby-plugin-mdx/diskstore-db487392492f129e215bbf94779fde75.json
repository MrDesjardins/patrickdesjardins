GitHub is widely known and used by several huge company, Microsoft included. It is a good place to publish your source code because it has a huge volume of users, it's easy to use and a lot of developer already have an account which let them participate to your project easily. Before setuping GitHub, we must create a file that describe the project which will be used as the main page when people come in you GitHub project. The second one is a ignore file that will discard binaries and other development files from being published. You can find a template to use on [GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore). Simply copy it and save it at the root of your project. The read me file is a markdown file. It must named **readme.md**.

GitHub is widely known and used by several huge company, Microsoft included. It is a good place to publish your source code because it has a huge volume of users, it's easy to use and a lot of developer already have an account which let them participate to your project easily. Before setuping GitHub, we must create a file that describe the project which will be used as the main page when people come in you GitHub project. The second one is a ignore file that will discard binaries and other development files from being published. You can find a template to use on [GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore). Simply copy it and save it at the root of your project. The read me file is a markdown file. It must named **readme.md**. The files structure should look like this :\n\n![](images/FileStructureWithReadMe.png)\n\nNext step is to create your project on GitHub. ![](images/GitHubNewRepository-1024x763.png)\n\nThis is very fast and once it's created you can go in the root of your project with a console and use git : \\`\\`\\` \n git init git remote add origin https://github.com/MrDesjardins/DotNetCircuitBreaker.git git add . git commit -m \"first commit\" git push -u origin master \n`}</code></pre>\n    <h1>{`Continuous Integration`}</h1>\n    <p>{`The next step is to have every time your push new code on GitHub to have this one built and your test ran.
