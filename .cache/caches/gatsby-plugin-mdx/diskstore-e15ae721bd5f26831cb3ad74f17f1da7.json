However, we can also specify the name of the variable we want which can be handy if the schema returned from the Rest Api doesn't satisfy the convention you are using. Let's do an example where we change the name to have underscore in front of each variable that we extract. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nconst {id:_id, name:_name, email:_email} = user; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`We can also have some cases where the information you get may not contain the property desired. For example, the user may have a field numberOfChildren with an integer if this one has at least one child and return nothing if no children. In that case, we would want to have a default value to 0.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`const {id, name, email, numberOfChildren=0} = user; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{` In the case that the user has numberOfChildren defined, this one will take over the default value. In all cases, we can be sure that numberOfChildren variable will be set with a value.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Take the remaining of the field into an object`}</h3>\n    <p>{`As seen in the previous section, you can extract specific fields into variable. But, you can also store all the remaining fields into a new object. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nconst {id, email, ...allRemainingFields} = user; `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{` The value of allRemainingFields is an anonymous (any) object with the field email, website, isPaidUser.\n\n### Copy array values into variable\n\nThis scenario is handy if you accept an array for parameter and needs to extract values by position. For example, you expect to receive an array of 3 elements and that you want to store these 3 elements in a variable. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nconst myArray = [\"patrick\", \"desjardins\", true]; const [firstName, lastName, hasPaid] = myArray; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{` You probably ask yourself about what if the array doesn't contain at least 3 items that won't work! Well, you can also use default value. Here is an example where the website was not passed in the array. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nconst myArray = `}{`[\"patrick\", \"desjardins\", true]`}{`; const `}{`[firstName, lastName, hasPaid, website=\"none\"]`}{` = myArray; `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`\n\n### Swapping value between variables\n\nMaybe not as useful but still interesting to have in your tool belt is two swap value between two variables. Doing it manually requires to have a temporary variable. You take the value of var1 set it to tempo, take value of var2 set it to var1 and set var2 with tempo. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nlet var1 = 100; let var2 = 300; let tempo;\n\ntempo = var1; var1 = var2; var2 = tempo; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Now, you can do it in a single line without temporary variable. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nlet var1 = 100; let var2 = 300; `}{`[var1, var2]`}{` = `}{`[var2, var1]`}{`; `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{`\n\n### Take the remaining of the values of an array into a new array\n\nThis is similar to what we did with object's fields, but this time with an array. We can set some array values into variables and the remaining into a new array. \\`\\`\\`typescript\nconst myArray = [\"patrick\", \"desjardins\", true]; const [firstName, ...remaining]; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{` In this example remaining is : `}{`[\"desjardins\", true]`}</p>\n    <p>{`We saw a lot of different scenario where destructuring could be interesting by avoiding several lines of code for simple object or array manipulation. In an upcoming article we will see about the second operator called spread and how this one can simplify even more your JavaScript/TypeScript code.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
