For example, if you have \"EntityA\", the pattern would be to have \"EntityA\" and \"EntityANormalized\" and \"EntityADenormalized\" that inherit \"EntityA\". During the mapping (and the creation of EntityADenormaliez) you use all the common property from \"EntityA\" which reside inside Redux's store that hold instances of EntityANormalized and you remove all keys and array of keys to replace them with the other object in the store. For example, if you have EntityA that has a relationship to B, the EntityANormalized have \"EntityB:number\" which won't be used in EntityADenormalized because this one will have \"EntityB:EntityBDenormalized\". Once you have these three interfaces created, you can create a EntityA model which contain a 1-1 relationship to the denormalized entity but also can have other data needed in the React component. For example, you can have Routing data, other denormalized entities, or global user's preference data, etc. The fifth interface contains a list of all potential action the user can execute in the component. Finally, a simple interface that extends the Model and Dispatch interface is created and used by the React component has its property.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The final result is of all the interface created look like this UML diagram: `}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"481px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/a3a7120d8d0b3c921d557b55e6f1e351/d024a/TypeScriptReduxModelsOrganization.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"79.33333333333333%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"TypeScriptReduxModelsOrganization\",\n            \"title\": \"TypeScriptReduxModelsOrganization\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/a3a7120d8d0b3c921d557b55e6f1e351/d024a/TypeScriptReduxModelsOrganization.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/a3a7120d8d0b3c921d557b55e6f1e351/5a46d/TypeScriptReduxModelsOrganization.png 300w\", \"/static/a3a7120d8d0b3c921d557b55e6f1e351/d024a/TypeScriptReduxModelsOrganization.png 481w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`The advantage of this modeling is the reusability for the base class (EntityA) by the normalized and denormalized. It is also clear to all developers that code in the system that these fields are coming from the backend and are \"values\" while the normalized contains the relationship keys. The mapping contains the logic to denormalize the object providing to React a rich model that has a good navigability in the properties of all objects but also contains fields that might be dynamically computed during the mapping. Finally, the division of model and dispatch work flawlessly with React-Connect because the connect function require to pass each type. It is also convenient because if you have a hierarchy of component you can pass only action or a set of model depending to which children React components have.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Here is an example of how React-Redux's connect function takes the model and dispatch types as well as how the React component for EntityA uses the property. `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`export default connect<EntityAModel, EntityADispatch, {}, {}, ReduxState>( (s) => entityAMapper.mapStateToProps(s), \n(s) => entityAMapper.mapDispatchToProps(s), \n(stateProps, dispatchProps, ownProps) => Object.assign({}, ownProps, stateProps, dispatchProps), { \n  pure: true, \n  areStatesEqual: (n, p) => entityAMapper.shouldMappingBeSkipped(n, p) \n  } \n)(EntityA)\n\nclass ComponentA extends React.Component<ComponentAProps> { } \n`}</code></pre>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
