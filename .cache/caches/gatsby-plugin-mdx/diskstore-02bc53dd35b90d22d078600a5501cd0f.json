This can be done with purely CSS. The idea is to set an animation that will be executed once. The start of the animation should be that the container is hidden and out of the screen with the end of the animation to its final position with full opacity. The CSS needs to have 3 more lines.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-css\"\n      }}>{`opacity: 1;\nanimation: toast 500ms cubic-bezier(0.23, 0.82, 0.16, 1.46);\nanimation-iteration-count: 1;\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The animation is called \"toast\" and iterate once and has a duration of 500ms. The cubic-bezier is set to create a bouncy effect.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-css\"\n      }}>{`@keyframes toast {\n  0% {\n    opacity: 0;\n    transform: translateY(200px);\n  }\n\n  100% {\n    opacity: 1;\n    transform: translateY(0px);\n  }\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The end result is as planned which pop once when the error is added into the DOM. `}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"./images/red_toast.mp4\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img>{`\n`}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`video: /images/red_toast.mp4`}</inlineCode></p>\n    <p>{`Indeed, this solution is not elaborated and mundane to anyone using something more rich in feature. However, the size of this solution is tiny and for an edge case fit perfectly the situation. If you want to see the code in action I created a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://codepen.io/mrdesjardins/pen/BxOVNJ\"\n      }}>{`CodePen`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
