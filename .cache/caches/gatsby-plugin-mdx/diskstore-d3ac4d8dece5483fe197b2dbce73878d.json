It's also on the frame of OWIN, so we have almost all positive features without the negative parts. Finally, Identity does have the clean way to have custom field to extend default username/password attribute. It's clean because it creates specific columns for each field. So, if you have an existing Asp.Net MVC, how do you upgrade to the Identity framework for authentification?

Providers are not required and everything will go with the service layer, to the data access layer to the database with Entity Framework (EF).
