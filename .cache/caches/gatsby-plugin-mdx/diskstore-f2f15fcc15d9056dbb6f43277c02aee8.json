Nevertheless, with some breakpoints and a little bit of time I was quite satisfied to see what can be done. You can do much more than what proposed, for instance, you can calculate the payload size and get more insight into what is not efficient. For example, I realized in the process of creating another exception that was throwing an exception when a maximum threshold of HTTP request was reached was still letting GraphQL continue its traversal causing the exception to occurs on every future node.
