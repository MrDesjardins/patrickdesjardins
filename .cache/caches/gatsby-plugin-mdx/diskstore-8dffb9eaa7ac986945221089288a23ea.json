After, it creates the worker. This is done by using the Worker class and passing a relative path to the WebWorker JavaScript file. After, we need to subscribe to a worker which of type \"message\". This allows to pass messages between the page and the WebWorker. Finally, there is a timeout of 1 sec before passing the request command down. The reason is that we need some time to the WebWorker to instanciate and register to listen to command. As you can see the postMessage is the way to call the WebWorker with some arguments.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The WebWorker is using the same algorithm that the one execute in the main script which was loading it from an other module.

Then, we need to configure RequireJs with a minimum configuration. Then, we call require to load the algo module. A good thing is that you can use console.log as well as the debugger keyword to debug the WebWorker. Next, you need to subscribe to the \"message\" event to be able to receive the postMessage from the webpage. Once we receive a message, we get the parameters, instantiate the algorithm class and wait the result. Once the result is out, we postMessage back to the page. I had to cast to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`any`}</inlineCode>{` to have access to postMessage (there is probably a better way).`}</p>\n    <p>{`The end result is way better and as you can see, the interface doesn't pay the price. However, if you have keen eyes, you also saw that I reduced the multiplier count from 99 887 766 554 to 50 000. That is a lot less! Why? Because keeping the same huge value was killing the WebWorker. By that, I mean that the algorithm was running forever. The whole process was running more slowly than the main thread for an unknown reason to me (at this time I am writing this post). I'll have a future post about why it's slower, but for the moment, if you need to have some telemetry task, or small task that block the UI just for more than few seconds (but not too much!), it may be worth it to move some logic down to a WebWorker. Also, as you can see, TypeScript is totally possible with WebWorker without a lot of hassle which is a big plus for anyone working with TypeScript project.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
