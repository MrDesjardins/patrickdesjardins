Unfortunately, it is slow. Even on a small code base, the process can take 10-15 seconds. Nonetheless, you have your TypeScript type generated for you and it will adapt with the backend (GraphQL server) changes.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Conclusion`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Having the type generating automatically from the backend is fascinating and is efficient. If your business domain is rich in quantity of entities (interfaces) and if many of them have several fields and complex interconnection than having the type generated instead of typing it manually is a relief.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Related GraphQL Articles`}</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"getting-started-with-graphql-for-netflix-open-connect\"\n        }}>{`Getting Started with GraphQL for Netflix Open Connect`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"install-apollo-server-to-host-a-graphql-service\"\n        }}>{`Install Apollo Server to host a GraphQL service`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"apollo-server-and-secured-playground\"\n        }}>{`Apollo Server and Secured Playground`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-context\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL Context`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-query-with-argument\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL Query with Argument`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"apollo-graphql-resolvers-and-data-source-separation\"\n        }}>{`Apollo GraphQL Resolvers and Data Source separation`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"how-to-setup-a-typescript-nodejs-express-apollo-server-to-easy-debugging-with-vscode\"\n        }}>{`How to setup a TypeScript, NodeJS, Express Apollo Server to easy debugging with VsCode`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-resolvers-with-apollo\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL Resolvers with Apollo`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"configuring-apollo-playground-and-api-on-two-different-url\"\n        }}>{`Configuring Apollo Playground and API on two different URL`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"how-to-automatically-generate-typescript-for-consumer-of-your-graphql\"\n        }}>{`How to automatically generate TypeScript for consumers of your GraphQL`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-extension-to-collect-http-and-resolvers-telemetry\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL and HTTP Telemetry`}</a>{`  `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"how-to-consume-graphql-in-typescript-and-react\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL and TypeScript/React`}</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
