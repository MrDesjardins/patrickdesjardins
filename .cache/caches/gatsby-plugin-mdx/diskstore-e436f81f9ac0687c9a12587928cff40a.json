First thing is to install a dev dependency to \"jest-junit\". The reason is that we need to convert the format of Jest into Junit.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{` npm install --save-dev jest-junit \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The next step is to download a Python script in your repository. I have mine in \"tools\". The reason is also about converting. Jest coverage file is not in the right format. The Python script converts the locv into Cobertura format. You can download once the script at this address. `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{` wget https://raw.github.com/eriwen/lcov-to-cobertura-xml/master/lcov_cobertura/lcov_cobertura.py \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Few configurations are required in the package.json. The first one is to create a test command that Jenkins execute instead of the default test command. The command calls the react-scripts. I am using TypeScript, hence I have to use the react-scripts-ts command. The next parameter is the \"test\" command which we still want to execute. The change starts with the test results processor. This is where you specify the jest-junit to execute once the tests are done. I set my coverage to be positioned into the \"coverage\" folder which is the folder I have ignored in the .gitignore and where I have normally my local coverage file outputted. Here are the three commands I have. The first one runs the test, the second run and coverage for the ci (this is the new stuff) and the last one is when I want to run locally the coverage.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{` \"test\": \"react-scripts-ts test --env=jsdom\", \n \"test:ci\": \"react-scripts-ts test --env=jsdom --testResultsProcessor ./node_modules/jest-junit --coverage --coverageDirectory=coverage\", \n \"coverage\": \"react-scripts-ts test --env=jsdom --coverage\", \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Finally, you need few jest-unit configurations. This can be in your package.json. I have some coverage folder that I want to exclude which you can do in the jest configuration under collectCoverageFrom. I had these before doing the task we are doing of configuring Jenkins. Then, the coverage reported must be lcov and text. Finally, the new configurations are under \"jest-junit\". The most important configuration is the \"output\" which is again in the coverage folder. You can change the destination and file as you wish. However, remember the location because you will need to use the same in a few instants inside Jenkins.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{}}>{` \"jest\": { \n   \"collectCoverageFrom\": [ \"**/*.{ts,tsx}\", \"!**/node_modules/**\", \"!**/build/**\", \"!**/definitionfiles/**\", \"!**/WebWrokers/**\", \"!**/*.mock.ts\", \"!src/setupTests.ts\" ], \n   \"coverageReporters\": [ \"lcov\", \"text\" ] }, \n   \"jest-junit\": { \"suiteName\": \"jest tests\", \"output\": \"coverage/junit.xml\", \"classNameTemplate\": \"{classname} - {title}\", \"titleTemplate\": \"{classname} - {title}\", \"ancestorSeparator\": \" > \", \"usePathForSuiteName\": \"true\" }, \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`In Jenkins, you need to add 2 build steps and 2 post-build steps.
