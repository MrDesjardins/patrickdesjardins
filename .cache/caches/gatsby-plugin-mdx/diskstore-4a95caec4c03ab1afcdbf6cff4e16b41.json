One negative point that we hear with IIS is that when the application pool sleep, the user that do a query have a penalty of time on its first query. This can lead to several second of waiting. It is interesting to note that since at least 5 years that we can have IIS to auto start. It is also interesting to note that we can also make IIS not to become idle.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Changing IIS Idle Time`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The first step to improve IIS performance is to remove the time out. This can be done by opening IIS, open the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Application Pool`}</strong>{` you want to change the setting and to open the Advanced Setting Window. The window has a Process Model section where you will find `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Idle Time-out (minutes)`}</strong>{` setting. You can set this property to 0. By default, the Application Pool also recycle every few minutes. You can set it to 0 to have this one not recycle. This will cause a higher availability of IIS during the day where most client are. If your application have low period, let say that you are building for an internal website for a company, you can set a absolute time to recycle. This can be set in the same screen as before, the Advanced Setting of the Application Pool, by changing the Specific Times. For example, we can set to recycle the pool at 1 am every day.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"387px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/0e1d0a2d4672098f4e9bda85a743a5b0/691c3/AdvancedSettingApplicationPoolIISNoSleep-387x400.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"103.33333333333331%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"AdvancedSettingApplicationPoolIISNoSleep 387x400\",\n            \"title\": \"AdvancedSettingApplicationPoolIISNoSleep 387x400\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/0e1d0a2d4672098f4e9bda85a743a5b0/691c3/AdvancedSettingApplicationPoolIISNoSleep-387x400.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/0e1d0a2d4672098f4e9bda85a743a5b0/5a46d/AdvancedSettingApplicationPoolIISNoSleep-387x400.png 300w\", \"/static/0e1d0a2d4672098f4e9bda85a743a5b0/691c3/AdvancedSettingApplicationPoolIISNoSleep-387x400.png 387w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <h2>{`Auto Start`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The auto start functionality is something that allow you to do an action when IIS start your application pool.
