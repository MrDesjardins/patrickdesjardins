For example, GraphQL works on HTTP(s), but also WebSockets. There is also the possibility to manage a safe list of known clients. GraphQL gives a possibility to test schema changes. Versioning is a matter of deprecating fields, no version number involved.  `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Let's get started`}</h2>\n    <p>{`As the first post, I believe it makes sense to start from the beginning: placing the first brick of the structure. The variety of \"material\" to settle the foundation can be challenging.  There are many implementations of GraphQL. Per se, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://graphql.org/\"\n      }}>{`GraphQL is a query language`}</a>{` and nothing more. The community (and support) mostly motivated the decision to go toward one or another choice. The features of the free-tier and pro-tier (if available) as well as the direction that most of Netflix's team were already invested or interested to move. Without going in too much detail, I decided to choose `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.apollographql.com/\"\n      }}>{`Apollo`}</a>{` with their NodeJS based solution.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In summary, they have an open source client and server with the possibility to have further features that require a paid subscription. The NodeJS approach is interesting because we use TypeScript for all our front-end application. It also allows us to leverage many NPM packages that we are familiar as well as having a lot of flexibility that the JavaScript ecosystem provides.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We already have several REST services with many endpoints. They are built in several formats, the responses are not always in strict REST flavors, and many schemas exist for similar entities. We also have a limited of gRPC services in which I foresee a potential possibility to auto-generate TypeScript definition files. GraphQL seems to be promising because it allows stitching different technologies and also allows to perform a custom merge of information.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`High level architecture`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Before going head down into building with Apollo and GraphQL, let's draw what is going to be built. First, everything must be secured. At Netflix, we have a paved path that handles the authentication and it is baken within Apache. As mentioned, Apollo is leveraging NodeJS. This is not an issue because we can deploy on the server the Apache server that will redirect all HTTP requests to NodeJS. Having Apache as the front server wrap NodeJS for the security. NodeJS will not be accessed directly outside the machine and only Apache will be able to communicate with NodeJS. In the eventuality that there is a bug and NodeJS is accessible, the request will not go very far: it won't be authenticated hence will fail on the actual web service.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"621px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/3d616b169552233a018091db33e14d49/3075e/GraphQLServers.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"26.666666666666668%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAwElEQVQY002Q2QrEMAhF8/+f2D6V7hvdm9DtDkemwwTEqNcTjdP3LMtiliSJhmHQtm1q29b8PM+WJ/beW/26LtV1rTzP1fe9uq6zuiOgqWkaZVmmOI6VpqmJi6JQWZaapknneeo4DvPruhqYHuDA0O/7LkeAADAJ7nggiKqqsubneQxOLYTw0zIEYLR4R8N93xrH0RJRFFmR8XmMHI0A0XF4ACjrvlqMoRwCxDTxh//+nYKYOwaMHIe/BcLaAFn5A9vhfVvpfcAAAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"GraphQLServers\",\n            \"title\": \"GraphQLServers\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/3d616b169552233a018091db33e14d49/3075e/GraphQLServers.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/3d616b169552233a018091db33e14d49/5a46d/GraphQLServers.png 300w\", \"/static/3d616b169552233a018091db33e14d49/0a47e/GraphQLServers.png 600w\", \"/static/3d616b169552233a018091db33e14d49/3075e/GraphQLServers.png 621w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`To simplify the development, I'll reuse a recipe that I have been using since I joined Netflix which is to develop with a Docker container.

I foresee also a lot of code generation from Protobuf from our services that are gRPC allowing a good developpement experience at the NodeJS layer. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`My Previous GraphQL Articles`}</h2>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"getting-started-with-graphql-for-netflix-open-connect\"\n        }}>{`Getting Started with GraphQL for Netflix Open Connect`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"install-apollo-server-to-host-a-graphql-service\"\n        }}>{`Install Apollo Server to host a GraphQL service`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"apollo-server-and-secured-playground\"\n        }}>{`Apollo Server and Secured Playground`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-context\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL Context`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-query-with-argument\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL Query with Argument`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"apollo-graphql-resolvers-and-data-source-separation\"\n        }}>{`Apollo GraphQL Resolvers and Data Source separation`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"how-to-setup-a-typescript-nodejs-express-apollo-server-to-easy-debugging-with-vscode\"\n        }}>{`How to setup a TypeScript, NodeJS, Express Apollo Server to easy debugging with VsCode`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-resolvers-with-apollo\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL Resolvers with Apollo`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"configuring-apollo-playground-and-api-on-two-different-url\"\n        }}>{`Configuring Apollo Playground and API on two different URL`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"how-to-automatically-generate-typescript-for-consumer-of-your-graphql\"\n        }}>{`How to automatically generate TypeScript for consumers of your GraphQL`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"graphql-extension-to-collect-http-and-resolvers-telemetry\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL and HTTP Telemetry`}</a>{`  `}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"how-to-consume-graphql-in-typescript-and-react\"\n        }}>{`GraphQL and TypeScript/React`}</a></li>\n    </ul>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
