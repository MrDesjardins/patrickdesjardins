The solution is to acknowledge the fear and to see the task as fun experimentations where failing is okay. In the end, having this attitude let you go through and most of the time success will be there.

E.g. university performing hazing activity to join a student fraternity.`}</p>\n    <p>{`It is more efficient to have a very small reward for a big commitment. Motivation must be from inside the person to be strong in time. The person must feel a personal responsibility and not motivated by the reward or a consequence to behave. E.g. The kids who were saying that a teacher would be angry if they played with a particular toy. It was working until the user was substituted. The group of children who had to receive the consequence speech played with the toy above 70% while the other group who was explained why without reward or consequences played with less than 20%.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Social pressure has a big impact to motivate action. The book presents the example of a kid that does not want to swim until he plays with other kids who can do it and the example of how sect operate. The social proof is that in doubt people follow the herd. It is the concept of pluralist. However, unknown groups of people have less change to help because they are unsure of how the emergency is and people in the group do not want to look bad. The trick is to remove uncertainty. In case people are uncertain, they will copy others.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The halo effect is when one characteristic overshadows all other traits of someone. Physical trait (how beautiful is someone) is a common one but being kind is another. Similarity produces liking. A compliment works well, even if fake, even if known to be fake. People like more people that have something familiar. They will believe the person more if they can think alike or have a similar past.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The book slightly discusses the influence of seeing something much time that alter our judgment. E.g., picture flashing in sight. There is also guilt by association. E.g., a pretty girl next to a car will influence the first impression of the car from the pretty girl.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The idea of performing something kind create the feeling that the person is on the same side and hence will be willing to comply easily. E.g. if a waiter at a restaurant help you save some money on an appetizer, his tips might be bigger at the end or a future more expensive suggestion will be with a higher probability to be accepted.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The fear of losing something is bigger than the motivation to gain. However, hope is a bigger motivator than fear.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Scarcity is something that seems rare in appearance and the feeling worth more for people. It works with time as well.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`The Hundred-Page Machine Learning`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Another book I read is `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://themlbook.com/\"\n      }}>{`\"The hundred-page machine learning book\"`}</a>{` by Andriy Burkov. I read this paperback book as a compliment for my first course. The book is short and does not cover every topic as I was expecting (for example KNN is 1 page long) but the first chapters were interesting for me. Mostly about the notation summary because some of the topics were far in my memory.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
