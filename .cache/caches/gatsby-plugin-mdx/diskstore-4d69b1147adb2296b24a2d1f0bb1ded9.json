It was without any application architecture like Flux. It was a first experience that didn't impressed me. The page I created was a Visual Studio Team Services hub extension that had some textboxes, combobox, graphics and information were pushed through SignalR. The hackathon was 4 days of development and like anything new, some ramp up was needed. Nevertheless, it was working at then end with a sour taste in mouth. I couldn't really find why I wasn't in love with React since everybody seemed to love it so much. Argumentation about having a clear separation between component and logic didn't make a lot of sense since we could do as well since many years, with some rigor. I also found that this argument is a weak one since you can create messy code with React too and have logic in the component. In any cases, I didn't touch it since this spring with a new project in Visual Studio Team Services where I would need to design the whole page in React Facebook. This time, I wanted to leverage as much as possible and went with an application architecture that was a mix of Flux and Reflux.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Application Architecture a.k.a.

The community seems to prefer Redux, but this come with some heavier knownledge. Everything needs to be immutable and more restriction about where to change the information. Today, I understand more all the advantage of it, but it still more work to do. Also, beaware that we are using TypeScript so it's more than just single NPM command to get the boilerplate for a new project. I decided to take a simpler approach that doesn't need much and that could be done in TypeScript with just React and React Dom library. It ends up being Flux and Reflux. Flux because we are using Action Creator, and Reflux because we do not use Dispatcher. Why Action Creator? Because we wanted to have all business logic, call to the server with Ajax to be made not by the UI component, neither the store.
