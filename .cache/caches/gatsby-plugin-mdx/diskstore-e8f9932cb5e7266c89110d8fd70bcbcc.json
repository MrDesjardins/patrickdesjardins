Because the GraphQL server is behind the VPC, it is not directly accessible by the user. The external application can communicate to the GraphQL server and every front-ends request to fetch data are proxied by the web server application. The proxy is important. It means that the browser of external users is not directly connected to the GraphQL server. Instead, the browser performs an AJAX call to the respective web server and this one, on the behalf of the user will conduct the GraphQL query. The proxy is conducted with the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy.html\"\n      }}>{`ProxyPass`}</a>{` instruction of Apache.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Internal applications do not have many constraints but keeping the same pattern of proxying is a good habit. It simplifies CORS because the browser performs HTTP requests to the same server, and only underneath it communicate to other servers. It also simplifies the security by having a central point of communication (the web server) to communicate with backend secured services.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`GraphQL Single Schema`}</h2>\n    <p>{`An obvious solution is to have two schemas: one internal and one external. The solution is the only choice if you need to expose the GraphQL schema externally without exposing the definition of internal fields and entities. However, because I had the constraint of not exposing GraphQL outside, I could simplify the maintainability by having a single schema. The problem with many schemas is that it does not scale very well. First, when adding a field that is good externally, you need to add it twice. Then, when it is time to modify or remove, you need to keep in synchronization the different schemas. Any little boilerplate cause the engineering experience to be a burden but also is prone to errors.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In an ideal world, a single schema exists and we flag the field or entity to be only available internally.

Because it is a single graph, the field appears in the interactive Graphql Playground and is a valid field to request; even externally. However, when invoked, GraphQL at runtime will be able to read the directive and perform a logic. In our case, the logic will be to verify the source of the request and figure out if the request is internal or not. In the case of an internal request, the data will be part of the response. If the source is external, an exception will occur and the field will be undefined.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`How to build a GraphQL Directive?`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The directive is two parts: one is in the GraphQL language (design time) and one is the logic to perform at runtime.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In any .graphql file, you need to specify the directive to let know GraphQL about its existence.

The directive indicates that it can be applied to a type (`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`OBJECT`}</em>{`) or to a field (`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`FIELD_DEFINITION`}</em>{`). The directive could also have arguments. For example, we could have a more advanced need to specify which role can access which field.`}</p>\n    <p>{`directive @internalData on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION`}</p>\n    <p>{`The second part if to handle the directive. When merging all the resolvers and type definitions you can also specify the collection of directives.
