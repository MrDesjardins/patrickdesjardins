The reason is that other developer won't be able to find specific scenario and might duplicate test or not look at them. If you have thousand and thousand of tests, it become even more important. I like following the name with GivenXXX_WhenXXX_ThenXXX. It forces to have a structure of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Given`}</strong>{` a specific case `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`When`}</strong>{` specific configuration is provided `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Then`}</strong>{` you expect a specific result.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Here is a simple code.

This is something everyone should do. What happen if at some point a default value change but was required to be a specific value depending of the scenario. Without this test, you are not notified that something is breaking from the expected value. In that example, the expected value is NULL. If someone change it to an empty string, this might break other scenario that rely to compare on NULL to determine some state. Another testing scenario that I see often is about passing wrong value has parameter. In that particular example, null will break and return a null reference exception. Creating the test make you realize that you should probably handle that case and have a better code, like the following one:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{`public SimpleCode Merge(SimpleCode parameter) { if (parameter == null) { throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(parameter)); } var mergedObject = new SimpleCode(); if (parameter.Value != null || this.Value != null) { mergedObject.Value = parameter.Value ?? this.Value; } return mergedObject; } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`In that case, I just thrown an exception and will need to assert that particular exception. Why is that better than just having the null reference exception. For three reasons, first, it's clear that it shows that the null parameter is a known scenario. Second, today it's an exception, tomorrow it could be that we return a value. A change will make this particular test that expect a specific exception to become red and thus having a change in the test. The third reason is that if another exception is thrown, that I'll get an error. I expect to only have an argument null exception, not a null reference or an overflow. Any other cases will be considered a bug, not the one handled.`}</p>\n    <p>{`How many test should your write? As many as your code required. Is that time consuming? Of course. Automated tests take about 30-50% of the development time when well done. Your code base will have has many line of code for tests and for code. That is the cost of being able to run a lot of test multiple times per day as well as not having human resource to test. It's worth it because all these scenarios are hard to test for a human and since these tests are supposed to be fast, that you can run them often. The gain is enormous as the size of your code base increase. Your confidence in changing your code should remain high and new developer coming into the team won't be afraid to change something that disrupt the expectation. That said, I still strongly believe that automated tests should be paired with human testing before being released into the public, but this is another story.
