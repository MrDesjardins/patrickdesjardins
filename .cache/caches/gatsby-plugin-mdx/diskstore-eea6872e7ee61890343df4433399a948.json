In Redux, the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`applyMiddleware`}</inlineCode>{` function will use it to pass the store.dispatch down (we will see in a future article). As expected, the combineMiddleware method output twice since we have 3 functions. We can see the final output being the function returned by combineMiddleware function. The next function returns the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`functionWrapper`}</inlineCode>{` which is the function A, that call the function B with .`}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`..nextFunction`}</inlineCode>{` that is function C.`}</p>\n    <p>{`If change the last output statement to have the compose function execute the returned function, we will see more the flow of the execution.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`console.log(\"Compose Output\", compose(a, b, c)); // Change this line by: \nconsole.log(\"Compose Output\", compose(a, b, c)(final)); \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The output is different this time but calls twice \"What is next function\" since we have 4 functions having the \"final\" one that will be wrapped also but executed.

This is interesting since every function was also a function but with a pointer to the next one. It means that that the returned function \"A\" will be executed and since this one call next (which in that case is \"B\") the cascade will continue until the \"final\" function is called. The final function also calls next and for the moment doesn't do much. In fact, we can remove the \"return next\" from function \"final\" and to have the same output.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's alter another time the last line.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`console.log(\"Compose Output\", compose(a, b, c)(final)(\"!\")); \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`This time, we execute the composition of functions completely.

As we can see, the compose takes \"chain\" which is an array of the middleware configured and pass down as the \"final\" the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`store.dispatch`}</inlineCode>{`. It means that the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`store.dispatch`}</inlineCode>{` will call the result of all the middleware.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this article, we have dissected the small function `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`compose`}</inlineCode>{` of Redux. We saw that its goal is to wrap multiple functions and weave them together with a callback that allows chaining the result of each of them to finally be able to execute a final function on the cascade of results. For Redux, it will allow developers to dispatch action to reducers and having the dispatched action to alter the flow between the time the action is executed and persisted.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
