It’s under 180 lines of code. Before going into detail, let’s take one paragraph to explain the circuit breaker pattern.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Circuit Breaker pattern is named from house circuit breaker — something fail, it opens the circuit, thus does not do any damage. With code, the circuit breaker pattern is useful when we access a resource that can slow down the system. For example, you have a website that connect different services on different servers, and one server goes down. You do not want subsequent calls to that server to call all the time that server. Mostly because it will slow down the whole website by having to timeout before being able to continue the code. This is a simple example, but this can be applied to other scenarios. The principle remains the same: execute some code, if it works nothing change; if it fails than we put the system into a close state. The open state allows to skip trying to execute the failed code and do something else until the circuit goes into an alternate state where it tries again to see if it can close the circuit again.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The circuit breaker demonstrates, here, does not rely on a timer. A lot of time, this pattern is closed for an amount of time before trying to re-open. However, I do not like having a timer running so I simply prefer to keep the date time and check when attempting to call. I also like using the state pattern for this circuit breaker pattern since we are moving through 3 different states (opened, half opened, closed).`}</p>\n    <p>{`The first class is the one that each of the three classes will inherit. It contains some virtual methods that the state can define if required. It also has a constructor that take the circuit breaker class to let you access some methods like increasing the default count when an exception is rose.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{` public abstract class CircuitBreakerState { protected readonly CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker;\n\nprotected CircuitBreakerState(CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker) { this.circuitBreaker = circuitBreaker; }\n\npublic virtual CircuitBreaker ProtectedCodeIsAboutToBeCalled() { return this.circuitBreaker; } public virtual void ProtectedCodeHasBeenCalled() { } public virtual void ActUponException(Exception e) { circuitBreaker.IncreaseFailureCount(); }\n\npublic virtual CircuitBreakerState Update() { return this; } } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The first state is the open state. It contains the time where the state open (where something went wrong). When the state is instantiated, it set the current date time. This is required because if we want to update the state to the next one, the half-open one, we need to have at least a down period defined by the circuit breaker. It overrides two methods. The `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`ProtectedCodeIsAboutToBeCalled`}</em>{` where it tries to call the protected code. By protected code, I mean the code that is under the circuit breaker. This method try to update the state. If it can, than it goes into the half open state. Otherwise, it remains open.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{` public class OpenState : CircuitBreakerState { private readonly DateTime openDateTime; public OpenState(CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker) : base(circuitBreaker) { openDateTime = DateTime.UtcNow; }\n\npublic override CircuitBreaker ProtectedCodeIsAboutToBeCalled() { base.ProtectedCodeIsAboutToBeCalled(); this.Update(); return base.circuitBreaker; }\n\npublic override CircuitBreakerState Update() { base.Update(); if (DateTime.UtcNow >= openDateTime + base.circuitBreaker.Timeout) { return circuitBreaker.MoveToHalfOpenState(); } return this; } } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The second state is half open. This state is active only when the circuit went into something wrong and it tries to come back into an open one. This one is pretty small. It goes into open state if something is wrong, or it goes into the closed state if no exception is thrown. So, this is called after the threshold of time is done, it tries to close the circuit by calling the protected code. If this one fail, it creates a new open state where the time is resetted.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{` public class HalfOpenState : CircuitBreakerState { public HalfOpenState(CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker) : base(circuitBreaker) { }\n\npublic override void ActUponException(Exception e) { base.ActUponException(e); circuitBreaker.MoveToOpenState(); }\n\npublic override void ProtectedCodeHasBeenCalled() { base.ProtectedCodeHasBeenCalled(); circuitBreaker.MoveToClosedState(); } } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The last state is the closed state. This is the first state you start the circuit pattern and the one you want to be. This is where we set the failure count and move to open when the failure count reach the threshold is met. This is not absolutely required, but it lets you have some window before opening the circuit. For example, sometime the connection can just be not reliable and retrying right after make it works. So you can set a failure threshold of 3 failures before going in an open state for 5 minutes.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{` public class ClosedState : CircuitBreakerState { public ClosedState(CircuitBreaker circuitBreaker) : base(circuitBreaker) { circuitBreaker.ResetFailureCount(); }\n\npublic override void ActUponException(Exception e) { base.ActUponException(e); if (circuitBreaker.IsThresholdReached()) { circuitBreaker.MoveToOpenState(); } } } \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The biggest piece of code is inside the main class : the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`CircuitBreaker`}</strong>{`.
