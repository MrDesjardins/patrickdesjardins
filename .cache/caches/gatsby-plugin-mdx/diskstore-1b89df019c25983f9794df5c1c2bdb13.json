Also, when a function requires a lot of assignation, it is often a case that the method will be long. It means that it's even harder to have an idea of what is going on if assignations are done all over the function. I strongly believe that while assigning a long list of variables can be cumbersome that assigning them directly to several places reduce the readability and introduce more error (like forgetting one assignment in a specific case which keep an old assignment).\",\n        \"term\": true,\n        \"of\": true,\n        \"flexibility,\": true,\n        \"you\": true,\n        \"may\": true,\n        \"have\": true,\n        \"to\": true,\n        \"define\": true,\n        \"these\": true,\n        \"variables\": true,\n        \"but\": true,\n        \"the\": true,\n        \"code\": true,\n        \"is\": true,\n        \"structured\": true,\n        \"be\": true,\n        \"well\": true,\n        \"resistant\": true,\n        \"future\": true,\n        \"changes.\": true,\n        \"Also,\": true,\n        \"when\": true,\n        \"a\": true,\n        \"function\": true,\n        \"requires\": true,\n        \"lot\": true,\n        \"assignation,\": true,\n        \"it\": true,\n        \"often\": true,\n        \"case\": true,\n        \"that\": true,\n        \"method\": true,\n        \"will\": true,\n        \"long.\": true,\n        \"It\": true,\n        \"means\": true,\n        \"it's\": true,\n        \"even\": true,\n        \"harder\": true,\n        \"an\": true,\n        \"idea\": true,\n        \"what\": true,\n        \"going\": true,\n        \"on\": true,\n        \"if\": true,\n        \"assignations\": true,\n        \"are\": true,\n        \"done\": true,\n        \"all\": true,\n        \"over\": true,\n        \"function.\": true,\n        \"I\": true,\n        \"strongly\": true,\n        \"believe\": true,\n        \"while\": true,\n        \"assigning\": true,\n        \"long\": true,\n        \"list\": true,\n        \"can\": true,\n        \"cumbersome\": true,\n        \"them\": true,\n        \"directly\": true,\n        \"several\": true,\n        \"places\": true,\n        \"reduce\": true,\n        \"readability\": true,\n        \"and\": true,\n        \"introduce\": true,\n        \"more\": true,\n        \"error\": true,\n        \"(like\": true,\n        \"forgetting\": true,\n        \"one\": true,\n        \"assignment\": true,\n        \"in\": true,\n        \"specific\": true,\n        \"which\": true,\n        \"keep\": true,\n        \"old\": true,\n        \"assignment).\": true\n      }}>{`\nThere are pros and cons in both, but the one I illustrate has more pros than cons in my opinion.\n\nTo recap about the advantage of having to assign values and then calling or assigning:\n\n- Remove code duplication\n- Easier refactoring since only one signature to change\n- Clearer readability of what happen into a method\n- Allow faster refactoring into smaller methods\n\n\nexport const _frontmatter = {\"title\":\"How to Write a IF Statement that determine a value\",\"date\":\"2016-10-05\",\"categories\":[\"best-practices\",\"c-sharp\",\"javascript\",\"typescript\"]}\n`}</code></pre>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
