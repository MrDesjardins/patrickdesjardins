At the end, we loss the reference on one side which will require to us to rebind it later on.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A better solution is to use a different library of Json which can handle reference, by that I mean the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx\"\n      }}>{`Newton King Library`}</a>{`. This library support circular reference by add ID to object serialized.`}</p>\n    <p>{`First, you need to remove the serialization from the default Json serializer and use the Json Newton King Library. This can be done in the Global.asax.cs file. with the following code.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{`GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Formatters.Clear(); \nGlobalConfiguration.Configuration.Formatters.Add(new JsonNetFormatter(new JsonSerializerSettings()));\n\nvar jsonSerializerSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings { \n  PreserveReferencesHandling = PreserveReferencesHandling.Objects \n}; \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`As you can see, we are setting up the PreserceReferencesHandling.Ojects. This will add the reference to object when circular dependencies are found.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This setting add values into the Json structure that in the format \"$id\": \"1\" and instead of copying the object over and over (and creating a stack over flow), will use the syntax \"$ref\": \"1\" to refer to the object. For example, if we have an object Player that contain the Team and the Team contains the players, than we could have circular reference. The serialization with the library and the PreserceReferencesHandling will produce something similar to the code below if we serialize a single player.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The C# code: `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-csharp\"\n      }}>{` class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { var p = new Program(); }\n\npublic Program() { var t1 = new Team() { TeamName = \"MyTeam\" }; var p1 = new Player { PlayerName = \"Patrick\" ,PlayerTeam = t1 }; var p2 = new Player() { PlayerName = \"Melodie\" , PlayerTeam = t1 }; t1.Players.Add(p1); t1.Players.Add(p2);\n\nvar settings = new JsonSerializerSettings() { PreserveReferencesHandling = PreserveReferencesHandling.Objects }; string json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(p1, settings); Console.WriteLine(json); Console.ReadLine(); //Product deserializedProduct = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Player>(json);\n\n} }\n\npublic class Player { public string PlayerName { get; set; } public Team PlayerTeam { get; set; } }\n\npublic class Team { public string TeamName { get; set; } public List<Player> Players { get; set; } public Team() { this.Players = new List<Player>(); } } \n\nThe result: \n\\`\\`\\`javascript\n{ \n  \"$id\":\"1\", \n  \"PlayerName\":\"Patrick\", \n  \"PlayerTeam\": { \n    \"$id\":\"2\", \n    \"TeamName\":\"MyTeam\", \n    \"Players\": [ \n      { \"$ref\":\"1\" }, \n      { \"$id\":\"3\", \n      \"PlayerName\":\"Melodie\", \n      \"PlayerTeam\": { \"$ref\":\"2\" } } \n      ] \n    } \n} \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`If instead your serialize the team you will get: `}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`{ \n  \"$id\":\"1\", \n  \"TeamName\":\"MyTeam\", \n  \"Players\": [ \n    {\"$id\":\"2\",\"PlayerName\":\"Patrick\",\"PlayerTeam\":{\"$ref\":\"1\"}}, \n    {\"$id\":\"3\",\"PlayerName\":\"Melodie\",\"PlayerTeam\":{\"$ref\":\"1\"}} \n  ] \n} \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`To conclude, you have to remember two things with Asp.Net MVC and Entity Framework. First, if you have not disabled proxy, than you will have this object serialized and it will cause problem when serializing. Second, you need to break those circular reference to stop the possibility of stack overflow. Using Json Newton library is simple and powerful when it came to handling references.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
