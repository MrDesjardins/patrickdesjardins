The challenge is to fit the time between Netflix and my family.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"1200px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/2642d/ML4T_Participation.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"85.66666666666666%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"ML4T Participation\",\n            \"title\": \"ML4T Participation\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/c1b63/ML4T_Participation.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/5a46d/ML4T_Participation.png 300w\", \"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/0a47e/ML4T_Participation.png 600w\", \"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/c1b63/ML4T_Participation.png 1200w\", \"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/d61c2/ML4T_Participation.png 1800w\", \"/static/50acd4cff87669fe790b3d7c51355e59/2642d/ML4T_Participation.png 2003w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`Ended in second place in term of contribution on 967 students`}</p>\n    <p>{`On my free time, I created two public open source projects.

The main project is the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://github.com/MrDesjardins/dataaccessgateway\"\n      }}>{`Data Access Gateway`}</a>{`, \"DAG\", which is a library that helps handling redundant HTTP request, cache the response in memory or in a persistent storage (IndexDb).

The book will be an on-going project that I will revisit every year.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"1200px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/a18a6d7c24fc8d5f67241dadb50dd8e3/d165a/FrontBackBook1400Width.jpg\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"66.66666666666666%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"FrontBackBook1400Width\",\n            \"title\": \"FrontBackBook1400Width\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/a18a6d7c24fc8d5f67241dadb50dd8e3/e5166/FrontBackBook1400Width.jpg\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/a18a6d7c24fc8d5f67241dadb50dd8e3/f93b5/FrontBackBook1400Width.jpg 300w\", \"/static/a18a6d7c24fc8d5f67241dadb50dd8e3/b4294/FrontBackBook1400Width.jpg 600w\", \"/static/a18a6d7c24fc8d5f67241dadb50dd8e3/e5166/FrontBackBook1400Width.jpg 1200w\", \"/static/a18a6d7c24fc8d5f67241dadb50dd8e3/d165a/FrontBackBook1400Width.jpg 1400w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`My first TypeScript book: Holistic TypeScript`}</p>\n    <p>{`Furthermore, a few months after the release of the book, I received an offer to write a guide about Typescript.

First of all, Netflix Open Connect Partner Portal got released. The version 2.0 of the application was having a hard time before I joined. I rebooted the system, and I delivered the web appliance which had many good wins. Mostly around performance where the system can accomplish several tasks in a fraction of the time. Another success is in term of easiness of use and in term of insight with the telemetry system. The latter spurred life into the whole fleet of our applications. The last year at Netflix went pretty fast, mostly because it was interesting and I had a lot of freedom to execute solutions the way I desired. The result was a strong sense of belonging which is very powerful because it increases the accountability and sense of importance.`}</p>\n    <p><img parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"src\": \"images/2018-08-04_15-36-33.gif\",\n        \"alt\": null\n      }}></img></p>\n    <p>{`Netflix Partner Portal: BGP Configuration`}</p>\n    <p>{`Concerning the work I produced at Netflix, the top highlights are:`}</p>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`TypeScript`}</strong>{` is using beyond only the application I am actively working. I am glad that my teammates embraced typing their front-end code.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Bringing `}<strong parentName=\"li\">{`insight`}</strong>{` to the application I am developing. Before my arrival, we were blind in term of what the user was using, or what time a particular piece of the system was taking. It was harder to debug and it was also very subjective in term of what is using. Now, it is easy to know where to invest time, or to improve the code or even just to figure out how the user achieved a bug.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><strong parentName=\"li\">{`Performance`}</strong>{` improved quite a lot with the new code of the web application I built. I was replacing an old portal that was made in AngularJS. I decided to use TypeScript, Redux and React. I built an open source project to handle the fetching of data called `}<a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"data-access-gateway-project\"\n        }}>{`Data Access Gateway.`}</a>{` that I already covered. Also, a smarter bundling analysis, a reduction of third-party libraries and leveraging async importation were able to reduce by 30% the number of initial downloads.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Better `}<strong parentName=\"li\">{`user experience`}</strong>{`. One goal was to have our user to be self-sufficient, to reduce the number of communication we have with them. I designed a user interface that provided constant feedback with a system of \"what\" is going on, \"why\" the data is in that shape and \"how\" to fix or improve the condition of the data. Many descriptive popovers, a reduction of information to the bare minimum and many other changes were put in place.`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Finally, I am starting an initiative around `}<strong parentName=\"li\">{`GraphQL`}</strong>{` to have a better story about fetching the appropriate amount of data from the backend as well as consolidating our backend and frontend entity. This latest project will be mostly conducted next year.`}</li>\n    </ol>\n    <p>{`This year was also the first time I was spending that much amount of time at work. I had a crazy schedule to release Netflix Open Connect Partner Portal which leads me to go beyond my strict 40 hours per week that I have been able to maintain throughout all my previous years. That being said, I was still able to contain my hours in a reasonable amount compared to the average of Silicon Valley folks. For about five months, I had to give an additional 15%. With the high amount of side project, it was challenging but I was able to handle it. My trick was to stick to a well-defined schedule. In summary, it was looking like the following: `}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`1h Working on my master degree (mostly lecture and reading in the morning)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`8h work (bumped to 9h for the first 5 months)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`45 minutes (include morning and afternoon) commute with audio books (self-improvement)`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`3h with the family`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`2-3h of side project (books, open-source projects, preparation conferences) but mostly school assignments`}<br parentName=\"li\"></br>\n        {``}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`7-8h sleep`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Since the release, I have been able to come back to 40 hours which is greatly appreciated for my sanity. The master degree is taking me more time that I was originally expecting. On average, I have to spend 20 hours per week which is challenging with a young kid. I can keep up without having to spend time during the weekend (most of the time) by doing everything once she sleeps. However, I had to brim over 4-5 weekends for a whole afternoon to complete assignments or to perform an exam.

After thinking more than three years about it, I decided that it was the best time to move forward. Thinking forever about the perfect timing would lead to stagnation. After several conversations, we decided to move forward with the plan which will be completed around May 2019.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"568px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/54f4e1a5ce1e89da5cc8f11cc377ed4e/94a05/BabyNumberTwo.jpg\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"157%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"BabyNumberTwo\",\n            \"title\": \"BabyNumberTwo\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/54f4e1a5ce1e89da5cc8f11cc377ed4e/94a05/BabyNumberTwo.jpg\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/54f4e1a5ce1e89da5cc8f11cc377ed4e/f93b5/BabyNumberTwo.jpg 300w\", \"/static/54f4e1a5ce1e89da5cc8f11cc377ed4e/94a05/BabyNumberTwo.jpg 568w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`My daughter approves the idea of having a sibling`}</p>\n    <p>{`The recapitulation of this year is mostly positive. I can highlight failures in which I should particularly scrutinize to improve. For example, I have not done any physical exercise this year. I plan to go back to a low level of training gradually next year. A second failure was that I worked more time each week than expected. I target working a more reasonable amount of hour to avoid fatigue period which leads to having my patience going downhill. While the number of hours might not be astronomically high in Silicon Valley, it is still too much to enjoy my family and all the side projects I am carrying. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Finally, this year was awesome. Like the previous one and the one before an so on. I have been blessed and will continue to keep my options open for new challenges, opportunities, and possibilities to grow and expand my knowledge. In the last few years, I realized that having concrete dreams and aiming to jump on occasions is the key to enjoy an exceptional life.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
