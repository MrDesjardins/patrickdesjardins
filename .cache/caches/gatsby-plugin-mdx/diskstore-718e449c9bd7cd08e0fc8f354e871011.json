While wandering the Internet for resources about GraphQL and security, we often see cases where the security is not paramount -- it is easier to ignore security. The reality is that most corporation that desire to bring GraphQL will also need to secure the information. This article sheds light on how I approached the security in my implementation of GraphQL at Netflix for Open Connect.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Prelude`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In an ideal world, we have the GraphQL server getting the authorization from the corporate security infrastructure and the GraphQL delegate downstream to the actual data source the responsibility of returning an error. For example, if the data source is a REST API, the token of the user is used for the call, hence can return an HTTP code 401 and GraphQL will handle the error. However, in maybe the GraphQL exposes some internal services that were secured only by the premise that it was under a VPS (virtual private server). Meaning that not validation is actually performed. In that case, some custom code is required by the executioner of the service: GraphQL. Another case could be that the security is by a specific group of entity (organization, user, etc) meaning that you do not want user A to access user B information. Again, a strong security model would perform the validation at the source (Rest, SQL views, etc) but in the real world, it is not always the case. To mitigate the possibility of security issues among the sea of services that was cover in my scenario, the security was placed in GraphQL. Meanwhile, further modification in the data sources could be planned and put in place without compromising the delivery of the GraphQL server.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Exploring the possibilities`}</h2>\n    <p>{`One strength of GraphQL is the flexibility. The flexibility nature remains true for security and it opens many doors to where to secure the service. As mentioned earlier, the NodeJS server that host Apollo is behind Apache. The reason is that at Netflix, we have many tools integrated within Apache to secure the user like single-sign-on, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0. The Apache module is great for authentication but not for authorizing. It does check if the user is one that can access the GraphQL but does not discriminate on which information the user can consult.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"481px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/a1a60b1a7e0b1ace020108950986c506/d024a/GraphQLServers-Security.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"139.66666666666669%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"GraphQLServers Security\",\n            \"title\": \"GraphQLServers Security\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/a1a60b1a7e0b1ace020108950986c506/d024a/GraphQLServers-Security.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/a1a60b1a7e0b1ace020108950986c506/5a46d/GraphQLServers-Security.png 300w\", \"/static/a1a60b1a7e0b1ace020108950986c506/d024a/GraphQLServers-Security.png 481w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`Flow of the request from user to services that contain the information`}</p>\n    <p>{`Apache gives information about the user and provides the additional HTTP headers to NodeJS.
