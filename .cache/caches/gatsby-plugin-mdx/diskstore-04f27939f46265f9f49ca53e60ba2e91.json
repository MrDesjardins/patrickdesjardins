Normalized data means that every state has entities that describe their relationship with unique identifier instead of a deep object that contain children and other objects. In short, every entity are unique, not duplicated in the Redux state. Also, I assume that during the life-cycle of your application, your denormalize the objects when they need to be consumed to have fully fledged objects with deep and rich entities. A commonplace, to denormalize is inside the mapping between the reducer and React. Depending on the complexity this can be expensive to construct. A natural consequence of an active web application well normalized is that the mapping will be a bottleneck. If you have many actions, the mapping can happen quite often.

The lack of separation causes issues in term of performance. A user change should never make an already formed object to be recomputed and build again: they have not changed. The reason is that the tree of objects changes if one of its node is changing. Let's see the consequence with a small example. An organization contains a list of site which contains a list of appliances which contains many children and so on. If we set the property \"activeAppliance\" in one of the sub-reducer of an appliance, it will have a chain of effect. First of all, the object that holds the \"activeAppliance\" will get a new reference (because of immutability), then the sub-reducer will get a new reference and its parents. But, it does not stop there. All memoized data ofReSelect or Re-reselect are flushed. The reason is Re-select selector are logically linked to specific are of the Reducer trees and check if something has changed. If nothing has changed, it returns a pre-computed denormalized instance. However, if not present or if the memoized selector has changed (which is the case with this example in many ways) it will invalidate the cache an perform a denormalization.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Dividing the data from the source of truth, the API, from the one that the user is using while editing cause all the memoize data to remain intact. If a user is changing the active appliance, there is no need to invalidate a whole organization with all its sites and appliances. Thus, the separation allows avoiding computer data that barely change. In that example, the \"activeAppliance\" moves from \"Appliance\" sub-reducer to the \"AppliancesNotPersisted\" reducer. The change the reference on the \"AppliancesNotPersisted\" state and invalidate a limited amount of selector compared to the ones on the business logics entities.`}</p>\n    <p><span parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"display\": \"block\",\n          \"marginLeft\": \"auto\",\n          \"marginRight\": \"auto\",\n          \"maxWidth\": \"806px\"\n        }\n      }}>{`\n      `}<a parentName=\"span\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-link\",\n          \"href\": \"/static/d507bf43594794a03d8aff129c72592e/764be/ReducersSeparation-Page-2.png\",\n          \"style\": {\n            \"display\": \"block\"\n          },\n          \"target\": \"_blank\",\n          \"rel\": \"noopener\"\n        }}>{`\n    `}<span parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"paddingBottom\": \"43%\",\n              \"position\": \"relative\",\n              \"bottom\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"backgroundImage\": \"url('data:image/png;base64,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')\",\n              \"backgroundSize\": \"cover\",\n              \"display\": \"block\"\n            }\n          }}></span>{`\n  `}<img parentName=\"a\" {...{\n            \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-image-image\",\n            \"alt\": \"Not persisted data are separated from the main domain reducer\",\n            \"title\": \"Not persisted data are separated from the main domain reducer\",\n            \"src\": \"/static/d507bf43594794a03d8aff129c72592e/764be/ReducersSeparation-Page-2.png\",\n            \"srcSet\": [\"/static/d507bf43594794a03d8aff129c72592e/5a46d/ReducersSeparation-Page-2.png 300w\", \"/static/d507bf43594794a03d8aff129c72592e/0a47e/ReducersSeparation-Page-2.png 600w\", \"/static/d507bf43594794a03d8aff129c72592e/764be/ReducersSeparation-Page-2.png 806w\"],\n            \"sizes\": \"(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\",\n              \"margin\": \"0\",\n              \"verticalAlign\": \"middle\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\"\n            },\n            \"loading\": \"lazy\",\n            \"decoding\": \"async\"\n          }}></img>{`\n  `}</a>{`\n    `}</span></p>\n    <p>{`While this might sound simplistic - and it is - this little change had a big impact.
