Every row had one column for every hour of the day (24 columns). The table can be very verbose depending on how structured an organization is in term of sites and appliances. I opted to an improved visualization that removed the redundancy of the unused cells and leveraged `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"animating-a-react-component\"\n      }}>{`React and animation`}</a>{` to have the user following the transformation when changing options like timezone and visualization preferences. The result is that a user interfaces less clunky that displays four times more information for the same viewport.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Cache Fill Window`}</h2>\n    <p>{`I decided to design a simplistic user interface. The top row of the section is what the user can configure for the chart. The first selector allows choosing from a limited set of timezone available from the organization' sites. The second selection is how caches are sorted. Underneath is the result. You can see the actual time with the \"now\" pin and the hour used that are highlighted. This is a small detail that fades away most of the hours of the day instead of having a dedicated column as in the previous design.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I opted to remove the redundancy of repeating the hours on every row. The original design has on top of each appliance a row with 24 columns for each hour of the day. It was taxing the screen with redundant information and it was taking space were pertinent information can be positioned. The change lights up the readability but also give more room for useful data. To help the user having a clear idea of the time, I drop a line from the used hour down to the bottom of the page. Also, when the user hovers a cache, I have a popover that mentioned the time frame.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In term of navigability, it is possible to click on any cache to move to the detail page of this one. The green handle shows the manifest cluster of the caches. It has multiple goals. The first one is to show the name of the manifest cluster. The second is to indicate if the caches type (manifest cluster, global, flash). The third is for the future when we add the feature to allow the user to alter the time from a manifest cluster -- the green handle will be an actual drag-and-drop handle.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So, how it was built?
