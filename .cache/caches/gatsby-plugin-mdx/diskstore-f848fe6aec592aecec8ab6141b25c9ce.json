An alternative idea could be to have a single reducer per payload type, but this gets fast cumbersome the more your domain grows and require more consolidation once you get back to your React component. Your reducers should be designed to be flat, but also to support the idea of a specific domain. In the example above, a single reducer for user management makes sense.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this article, we saw that JavaScript allows us to have mixed kind of data in a single argument which we would act differently depending on the type (specified in a string). Then, we realized that when it's time to type, that it can be problematic since TypeSCript expects to have a clear idea of what type is needed before proceeding with the information. Finally, a solution that embraces strong type, union and type guard was proposed to accommodate Redux and being strongly typed.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Articles of the series:`}</h3>\n    <ol>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-1-the-big-picture\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript, React and Redux`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-2-creating-the-store-and-the-reducer\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript and Redux Store`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-3-binding-the-store-and-component\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript Redux Store Binding`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-4-multiple-returns-from-action-creator\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript Redux Action Creators`}</a></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ol\"><a parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"href\": \"./typescript-react-and-redux-part-5-reducer-with-different-actions\"\n        }}>{`TypeScript, React and Redux Part 5 : Reducer with Different Actions`}</a></li>\n    </ol>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
