Breaking down is crucial. Small components allow only to update a piece where the information changes. Immutability reduces complex checks and avoids having an issue in the long term if fields are added to the model (which would also require being added in the check of the component that consumed it).

The way Redux works is that an action triggers and then middlewares can generate more actions (with Thunk), and in the end, many mappings can occur to finally have many components involved. It makes sense to try to optimize at the source.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The idea is limited to a set of actions and cannot be applied to every action. This pattern works well, e.g., where you are fetching data and need to dispatch several actions or where you have a graph of an object that needs to be normalized by several reducers. In both cases, you want to have all reducers with all the data well saved in the Redux store to continue to lifecycle (mapping, rendering). The batch notion enters when you receive the payload or you have the result of the normalization. Instead of dispatching several actions, you batch them.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the following code, without batching, every five actions that are calling five different reducers would call the mapping code. Since the normalized data changes the store, it would trigger the denormalization code and the component to render because the data has changed. However, in reality, we want to have the UI to change once after all entities are well positioned in the Redux store.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`batchNotifications(next,         \n    Actions.normalizedEntityA(normalizedResponse.entities.A),     \n    Actions.normalizedEntityB(normalizedResponse.entities.B),\n    Actions.normalizedEntityC(normalizedResponse.entities.C),     \n    Actions.normalizedEntityD(normalizedResponse.entities.D),     \n    Actions.normalizedEntityE(normalizedResponse.entities.E) \n); \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`I wrote a simple implementation for the batch notification that sets a variable to “on” before executing the first element of the batch and turn it off at the last element.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`export function batchNotifications<S>(next: Dispatch<S>,\n    ...batchOfActions: Action[]): void {\n    next(SharedActions.actionUiBatchOn());\n    try {\n        batchOfActions.forEach((action: Action) => next(action));\n    } catch (e) {\n        Log.trackError(e);\n    } finally {\n        next(SharedActions.actionUiBatchOff());\n    }\n} \n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Because the batch is executed at the middleware level, I can create a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"how-to-have-a-hook-before-a-redux-store-notify-its-subscriber-with-typescript\"\n      }}>{`Redux Store Enhancer`}</a>{` wasted.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Short-circuit Redux mapping`}</h3>\n    <p>{`If you are using the React-Redux library, you are probably using the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`connect`}</em>{` function to create the link between the Redux store notification and your component.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`export default connect<YourModel, YourDispatch, {}, {},\n     YourStoreModel>(\n    (s) => model.mapStateToProps(s),\n    (s) => model.mapDispatchToProps(s),\n    (stateProps, dispatchProps, ownProps) => Object.assign({},\n     ownProps, stateProps, dispatchProps),\n    {\n        pure: true,\n        areStatesEqual: (n, p) => model.shouldMappingBeSkipped(n, p)\n    }\n)(YourComponent);\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`The pattern is to use the third parameter and assign the value “pure” to true and to set up a function to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`areStatesEqual`}</em>{`.

The map code is the second and third parameter of the `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`connect`}</em>{` function. This can be expensive to run if you need to denormalize your model for no reason. The check can be done simply by looking at the Redux store and comparing the previous value. You can target the exact portion of the state that should change before proceeding. If you are using an immutable model, the check can be quick.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This pattern and the previous one combined can save most of the rendering. I have witnessed more than 50% reduction of performance on user’s action by batching and short-circuiting the mapping. In my worst scenario, the mapping went from 24 to 12 by the short-circuiting value that was not present yet (waiting for middleware to dispatch the code from Ajax call) or not yet fully formed (middleware logic on the data).`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Avoid denormalizing untouched normalized data`}</h3>\n    <p>{`This optimization can be more time-consuming than the first two, mostly because of some difficulty with the library that you might use.

The cache can save some time if you have a rich, deep model with many lists and maps.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In my particular case, I’ve seen a performance gain on data that doesn’t often change with a list of thousands of entities that require being denormalized as well.

However, be aware that invalidation is only done by a change in the dynamic parameters or the state, and your store must be immutable. Otherwise, it becomes rapidly complex, and the cache might not work as expected.`}</p>\n    <h3>{`Immutable value with good should component update`}</h3>\n    <p>{`The last pattern is to break down your components into small pieces with a good `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`shouldComponentUpdate`}</em>{` function that can leverage the immutability model.
