At this day, the documentation is not very clear. Mostly because there is a clear separation between React, Redux, Redux-Connect, and React-Router. While it is very powerful to have each element of the puzzle separated, this comes with the price that the integration is in a gray area. Hopefully, this article uncovers some mystery around how to collection unhandled errors and removed confusion with the particular case of why mapping error can throw error through the React mechanism when not positioned at the right place.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
