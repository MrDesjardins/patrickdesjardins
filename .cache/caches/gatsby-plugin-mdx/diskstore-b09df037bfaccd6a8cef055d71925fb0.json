You need static only if you want to share between instance data. While static may be a performance improvement in C# for method, it's still true in TypeScript BUT you already have that gain with the default class function that generate prototype function. So the main question is when to use an instance function. The main scenario is that this method will be used in a callback mechanism where the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`this`}</strong>{` pointer may get lost. While there is many pattern around like creating a wrapper function.`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-typescript\"\n      }}>{`class User {\n  private name: string;\n  constructor(initialName: string) {\n    this.name = initialName;\n  }\n  public greet(): void {\n    console.log(\"Hello, \" + this.name);\n  }\n  public greet2 = (): void => {\n    console.log(\"Hello2, \" + this.name);\n  };\n  public assign = (s: string, x?: string): void => {\n    this.name = s;\n    if (x === undefined) {\n      console.log(\"Undefined\");\n    }\n  };\n  private static count = 0;\n  public static assignStatic() {\n    User.count = User.count + 1;\n  }\n}\nlet greeter = new User(\"Patrick\");\nwindow.setTimeout(greeter.greet, 10); // this won't be the user this\nwindow.setTimeout(() => greeter.greet(), 1000); // this will be user this\nwindow.setTimeout(greeter.greet2, 2000); // this will be user this\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`Be aware that I changed a little bit the method and added a greet2 that is an instance function. You can see that I use inside these methods to log out the string. The output is as expected that the first one won't be able to output the name.

About callback, using the arrow anonymous function is a great way if you do not need to release the pointer to this event. You may have to release memory manually and the easiest way in would be to use instance function. As you can see, it's not always black or white, but your line of though should be always to think about memory first.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}}
