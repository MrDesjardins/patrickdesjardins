This is a problem called \"N+1\". You will have 1 initial SQL hit and additional hit for each customer. This lead to huge performance problem. The magic of lazy loading suddenly disappear.

With eager loading, this would result to a single query. To notify which object to load inside the class, the use of _Include_ is required.
