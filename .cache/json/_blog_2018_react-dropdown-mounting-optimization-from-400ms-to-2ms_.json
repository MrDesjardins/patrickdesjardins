I am having this habit since the first FireBug extension was released from FireFox a very while ago! Once in a while, I collect performance and look at the result. It keeps me on my toes if regression occurs or merely to have a real picture of what is going on. What I found is that checking performance is even more critical when using React and Redux because many lifecycle events can generate a lot of performance hits. Recently, I noticed that one of the websites I was working was rendering a drop down that was taking 400ms to mount. The drop-down is visible in the main menu of the site hence it's a 400ms that is costly right from the start of the application. I also noticed that the value of this dropdown is change once in a while, thus a very expensive 400ms.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The profiler was very clear about the issue: every item of the drop-down was mounting, and the number of choices was reaching up to a thousand.

So, I ended up coding a rapid change to render the drop-down, but no item until the user opens the drop-down.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The hosting React component of the dropdown is receiving by property the list of elements to add in the drop-down.

The trick is coded in the \\\"onOpen\\\" method which executes code when the user clicks to open the drop-down. It transfers the list into the state.
