Recently, Redux introduced the option to be able to shim a callback function when the Redux store send the notification that its state has changed. This is great because it allows us to perform logic between the store and to connected components. This possibility is so much more important if you are not keeping calculated values in the store and only normalized value as well. A good pattern is to denormalized the value into rich objects in the mapping, as well as performing logic on the data just before rending the object. However, this comes at a cost that can be saved if we knew that the information is not complete or that some crucial pieces are not fully loaded yet. A common scenario is that you are waiting for several Ajax call to finish and once all the data in the store to perform a visual update.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"To be able to use the following code, you must have Redux version 5 and above.

The fourth parameter is where you can insert your own logic. The first step is that you need to specify that the store is pure. The second is to define a function. The function has two parameters which are the previous Redux store and the next store. This lets you do a comparison to determine if you should or not allow the notification to re-render. You can also only rely on the next store to see if the data desired is present. As you see, the function is named \\\"areStatesEqual\\\" and not \\\"shouldUpdate\\\". So, if your function returns true, it means that the two states are equal, hence do not need to send the notification to update.
