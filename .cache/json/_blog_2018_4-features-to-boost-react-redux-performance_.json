I have the habit of running the performance tools of Chrome quite often every day, and I noticed that a bad habit is to break down the render in private functions. The problem is that these functions are always executed even if the part they render is not changing. Breaking down into smaller components avoid this pitfall of wasteful rendering. In my case, not a lot of gain was realized because everything was correctly implemented. However, I noticed that the main menu was rendering an expensive user\\u2019s profile on every render.
