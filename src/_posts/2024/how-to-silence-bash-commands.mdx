There are ways to redirect the outputs of a terminal's command if the output is not desirable.

Before getting into the _how_, let's describe the concept of "File Descriptor" or `fd`. Using a terminal, you have three `fd`. The first one is the input. The terminal refers to the input file descriptor as `fd 0`. The second `fd` is the standard output, also known as `stdout` and `fd 1`. Finally, the third is the file descriptor for error, the `stderr` or `fd 2`.

|FD Number|File StreamName|Description|
|---|---|---|
|0|stdin|What the user typed as argument of the command|
|1|stdout|Output of the command that is not error|
|2|stderr|Error of the command|

To silence the `stdout` you redirect the output using the `>` into the _void_ using the destination `/dev/null`.

The following command:

```sh
ls 1> /dev/null
```
Redirect the `stdout` into the _void_, thus nothing appear in the terminal. 

The following command using the file descriptor 2, the `stderr`, redirect error, which mean that you still see the output of the directories and files

```sh
ls 2> /dev/null
```

But deleting an non-existing file does not show the error:

```sh
rm testme.test 2> /dev/null
```

If you want to have both, the `stdout` and `stderr` silenced, then you can use:

```sh
ls 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null
```

Or it's more compact form:

```sh
ls 1> /dev/null 2>& 1
```
The `& 1` (note the space) means that the output of the file descriptor 2 goes into the file descriptor 1. The file descriptor 1 goes to `/dev/null` thus everything is silenced.

The `1>` has a short form `>`. While less explicit, it reduces a character and is somewhat well known that the default is the `stdout`.

```sh
ls > /dev/null 2>& 1
```
There is also a shorter form to the common task of silencing "everything" which is to use `&>` without any file descriptor.

```sh
ls &> /dev/null
```

Instead of using `ls`, use `rm` on a file that does not exist.

```sh
> rm testme.test
rm: testme.test: No such file or directory
```
And then:

```sh
rm testme.test &> /dev/null
```
No error!
