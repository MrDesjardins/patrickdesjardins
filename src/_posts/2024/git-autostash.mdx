Keeping your branch up-to-date with the main branch or the feature branch is a necessity. Waiting too long and you may have more conflicts to resolve.

The normal command is invoking `git pull`. However, if you have uncommitted changes, you will need to stash them first or create a commit before receiving the upstream code.

To avoid having to stash your code and pop the stash later, we can add few lines in the `~/.gitconfig`. The change uses `autoStash` which will stash, pull and pop the stash for you.

```
[rebase]
	autoStash = true
[merge]
	autoStash = true
```
