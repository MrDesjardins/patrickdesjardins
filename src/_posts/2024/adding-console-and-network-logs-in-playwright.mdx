I will show you how to add console and network logs in Playwright. Logs are helpful when you have tests working locally but not on a CI/CD pipeline. You can use these logs to debug and understand what's happening.

The first step is to add the logs to the test. You can use the `page.on('console')` and `page.on('request')` functions to listen to the logs. To avoid repetitive code, you can add these logs into a fixture. A test fixture sets up the environment for the tests.


```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  page.on('console', (msg) => {
    console.log('PAGE LOG:', msg.text());
  });
  page.on('request', (request) => {
    console.log('REQUEST:', request.url());
  });
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const title = page.locator('.navbar__title');
  await expect(title).toHaveText('Playwright');
});
```

```ts
export const wrapper = ()=>{
  const consoleLines:string[]=[];

  const test = base.extend<MyFixtures>({
    workerStorageState:[
      async ({browser}, use):Promise<void>=>{
        const page = await browser.newPage();
        page.on('console', (msg) => {
          consoleLines.push(msg.text());
        });

        page.on('request', async(request) => {
          consoleLines.push(request.url());
          if(request.failure()){
            consoleLines.push(request.failure().errorText);
          }
        });
      },
    ],
    
  });
  test.beforeEach(async()=>{
    consoleLines.lenght=0;
  });
  test.afterEach(async({page})=>{
    if(test.info().status !== test.info().expectedStatus){
      console.log("Output of console logs for: " + test.info().title);
      console.log(consoleLines.join("\n");
    }
  });
  return test;
};
```

The code above is a simplification of the potential. The goal is to extend the base test and return a test containing the event that collects the logs into an array. If one of the tests fails, the wrapper prints the log in the console.

```ts
const test = wrapper();
test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  const title = page.locator('.navbar__title');
  await expect(title).toHaveText('Playwright');
});
```

Like the original test, the wrapper returns a function but has the events listening. The tests execute normally, but the logs are printed to the console if they fail. You can use the logs in a CI/CD pipeline to understand what's happening.
