One of my team mate would like to query some data with Linq but has always an error message saying that the Linq to Entity couldn't find the property desired. In fact, the exception was relevant because the property was made up in the model and were using two others properties available from the database.

To figure out more about the problematic let say that in the database you have the field : `Id, Name_Fr, Name_En`. Let say that in your model you have : `Id, Name_Fr, Name_En` and also `Name`. You would like to sort data by name. If you use directly your Entity Framework's data context to query with Linq To Entity you will get an error because database context will try to do a SQL query with the field Name which doesn't exist. The solution is to use Linq to Entity to query everything and to sort with Linq to Object.

So, instead of doing : 

```csharp
 MyDatabaseContext.MyPeople.OrderBy(c=>c.Name); 
```

You would have to do : 

```csharp
 MyDatabaseContext.MyPeople.AsEnumerable().OrderBy(c=>c.Name); 
```

The `AsEnumerable()` will execute the query which will return a collection of `IEnumerable` instead of `IQueryable`. The difference is that `MyPeople` is `IQueryable` which doesn't execute the query until the collection is enumerated (with ForEach for example) or until the query it transformed into a list (for example with `ToList()`).

The difference between `AsEnumerable()` and `ToList()` is concerning performance. The `AsEnumerable()` is faster if you do subsequent filtering (`.Where` for example) operation. The reason is that it will filter the query before looping instead of looping the whole collection and then looping to filter.
