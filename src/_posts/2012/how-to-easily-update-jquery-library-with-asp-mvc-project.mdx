It's always a good habit to have the latest framework updated. This way, you have most recent bugs fixed and all the new features available. This can be done manually by changing files but if you have **NuGet** installed can be done easily without having to download manually and to check for compatibility.

You can use **Update-Package jquery** to update JQuery which will not only get the latest JQuery version of the main library but also will get the UI, Validation and other Javascript librairies that is close to JQuery.

To be able to execute **Update-Package jquery** you will need launch the **Package Manager Console**. This is located in Tools>Library _Package Manager>Package Manager Console_.
