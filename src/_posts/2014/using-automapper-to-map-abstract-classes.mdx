`AutoMapper` lets you map from one class to another class your object. It works fine until you want to map from a class to an abstract class. The reason is that `AutoMapper` instantiates the desired class type and since an abstract class cannot be instantiate will crash.


```csharp
 //Mapping 
 Mapper.CreateMap<SelectorItem, OrderType>() 
 //Use the mapping 
 var model = AutoMapper.Mapper.Map<SelectorItem, OrderType>(viewModel); 
```

The code create the map from SelectorItem that is a normal class and OrderType that is an abstract class. The use of this map will not work. To fix this problem the mapping configuration must be changed to specify to `AutoMapper` how to instantiate the OrderType class, the abstract class.


```csharp
 Mapper.CreateMap<SelectorItem, OrderType>() .ConstructUsing(OrderTypeCreator); 
```

The mapping requires the use of ConstructUsing method that has two signatures.


```csharp
 IMappingExpression<TSource, TDestination> ConstructUsing(Func<TSource, TDestination> ctor); 
 IMappingExpression<TSource, TDestination> ConstructUsing(Func<ResolutionContext, TDestination> ctor); 
```

The first one is easy to use. It takes a method that has the source which is the class we start with and return a destination class that is the abstract class.


```csharp
 private OrderType OrderTypeCreator(SelectorItem arg) { return OrderType.GetFromId(arg.Id); } 
```

This example takes from the concrete class the ID and use a factory to return the correct concrete class that inherit form the abstract OrderType class.

This way, we have AutoMapper that can map to abstract Class without problem.
