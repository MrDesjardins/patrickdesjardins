Regardless of the framework you are using, you will end up having some area of code that relies on default values. When the state relies on an object, there is a way to ensure that the default values are not mutated in the future.

The simplest way to define a set of default values is to assign an object's value. TypeScript infers the object to be of two properties. The `p1` to be a `boolean` and the `p2` to be a `number`.

```typescript
const defaultValues = { p1: true, p2: 100 };
defaultValues.p1 = false;
``` 

A step further is to ensure the type does not change and be as narrow as possible using `as const`. In that case, `p1` type is not a boolean but `true`, and `p2` is if type `100`.

```typescript
const defaultValues = { p1: true, p2: 100 } as const;
defaultValues.p1 = false; // Error!
```

That is great for design time, but JavaScript has the `Object.freeze` that ensure that at runtime you cannot change an object. Using the `Object.freeze` generates a type of `ReadOnly<>` between the inferred type.

```typescript
const defaultValues = Object.freeze({ p1: true, p2: 100 });
defaultValues.p1 = false; // Error!
```

This is the same as:

```typescript
interface MyValueType {
  p1: boolean;
  p2: number;
}
const defaultValues: Readonly<MyValueType> = Object.freeze({ p1: true, p2: 100 });
defaultValues.p1 = false; // Error!
```

I like the explicit interface because we can use it around the application for a parameter. However, also possible to extract the type using `typeof`.

```typescript
type MyValueType = typeof defaultValues;
```
But, that is not right. We cannot use that type around the application because the extraction results to the type:

```typescript
interface MyValueType {
  readonly p1: boolean;
  readonly p2: number;
}
```
A more accurate extraction would be to use a mapped type.

```typescript
type UnReadonly<T> = { -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P] };
type MyValueType = UnReadonly<typeof defaultValues>;
```

The right approach is the one you defined with your team. Regardless, what is interesting is that you can have a safe type at runtime and design time and still be able to use the type in mutable are of your code when needed.
