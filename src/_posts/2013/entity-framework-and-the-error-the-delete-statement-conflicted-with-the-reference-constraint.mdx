Entity Framework can raise an error concerning a conflict with reference when deleting an entity. One of this error is the following one.

> The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint.

To solve this issue we need to delete cascade instead of a simple remove. We have seen in a previous post how to use [delete in cascade with Entity Framework](./entity-framework-4-3-delete-cascade-with-code-first-poco).

In short, you have to specify the many side to the other side (required or optional) and then specify the delete cascade statement with the true parameter.


```csharp
 ...HasMany(e => e.ParentDetails) 
 .WithOptional(s => s.Parent) 
 .WillCascadeOnDelete(true); 
```
