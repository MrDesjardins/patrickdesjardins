Application Insight is very powerful system that let you collect telemetry on your website. It's a service on Azure, which is currently free with the limitation to keep data for 7 days and aggregated data for 90 days.

One interesting thing you can do, without having to configure anything else than using Application Insight with your website, is to query the **pageViews** table. It allows you to get information about each page requested by user. However, if you are using an application you may have url with ID. For example `http://yourwebsite.com/user/12345/data/group/567/`. The problem is that you will get result with noise. The same page has variables in the url. A simple fix is to replace any integer. Here is a code you can use on your own data which replace integer with a 'x' character.

``` 
 pageViews 
  | extend replaced_operation_ParentName = replace(@'(\\d+)', @'x', operation_Name) 
  | where timestamp >= ago(7d) 
  | summarize c = count(replaced_operation_ParentName) 
      by replaced_operation_ParentName 
  | where c > 1 
  | order by c desc 
``` 

The result look like this:

This is pretty fast, with less than 1 sec I got all the result. If you are not using integer in your url, but Guid, you can change the Regex to replace the pattern of a Guid.
