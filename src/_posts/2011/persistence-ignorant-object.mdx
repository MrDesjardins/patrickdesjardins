What is a persistence-ignorant object?

It's an object that is not aware of any persistence. It doesn't know if it will be persisted with a database (or which one), neither if it will be saved in a XML file or a binary one. It's ignorant of that information. A POCO object is a persistence-ignorant class.

> POCO mean "Plain Old CLR Object"

You can have POCO or peristence-ignorant object with Entity Framework.
