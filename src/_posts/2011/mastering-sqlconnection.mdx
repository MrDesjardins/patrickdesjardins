The `SqlConnection` object is an object that derive of `DbConnection`. It opens the connection between the application and the database. It's also inherit of `IDisposable` because of `DbConnection`.


```csharp
var connection = new SqlConnection(); 
connection.ConnectionString = @"Data Source=PATRICK-PC\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=True"; 
connection.Open(); 
connection.Close(); 
```
or

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection()) { 
  connection.ConnectionString = @"Data Source=PATRICK-PC\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=True"; 
  connection.Open(); 
  connection.Close(); 
} 
```

These two snippets of code illustrate the creation of a connection. Both of them were using connection string from a string but the value can be directly loaded from the app.config or web.config.

```csharp
ConnectionStringSettings connectionStringSettings = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ApplicationServices"]; 
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionStringSettings.ConnectionString)) { 
  connection.Open(); 
  connection.Close(); 
} 
``` 

```xml
<configuration> 
  <connectionStrings> 
    <add name="ApplicationServices" connectionString="Data Source=PATRICK-PC\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Northwind;Integrated Security=True" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" /> 
  </connectionStrings> 
... ... 
```
